The molecular mechanisms underlying the augmentation are unclear. Nevertheless, significant progress has been made, pointing to some candidate systems which may be involved in SSRI-antipsychotic synergism. Thus, the enhanced dopamine release by SSRI-antipsychotic treatment is modulated by specific serotonergic receptors and by tyrosine hydroxylase. There are modifications in gamma-aminobutyric acid system via glutamate decarboxylase 67, protein kinase C beta and the receptor for activated C-kinase 1 (Rack1). Some studies indicate the input of transcription and neurotrophic factors as phospho-cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein, Fos and fibroblast growth factor-2. Alterations in calcium signaling (neurogranin, regulator of G-protein signaling and Rack1) and in cytokine receptors for interleukin-8 and chemokine have also been reported. While as yet limited in scope, the evidence suggests definable molecular targets which may be implicated in drug development based on SSRI-antipsychotic synergistic actions.},

	abstract = {Antipsychotics, old and new varieties, are effective against positive symptoms such as hallucination and delusions, but are often of limited value in treating core features of schizophrenia particularly negative symptoms. Developments of new drugs based on current dogmas have produced similar drugs with no breakthroughs in effectiveness. New knowledge as to which mechanisms are responsible for symptom productions and treatment is needed. There is evidence that response may improve when antipsychotics are augmented with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). This augmenting effect cannot be explained by summating pharmacological effects of the individual drugs. In a series of laboratory and clinical studies, we identified unique biochemical effects of the SSRI-Antipsychotic combination, different from each individual drug and suggested that some of these may mediate the clinical effect. In this paper, we review these studies and propose that modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptor and its regulating system is the mechanism by which SSRI antipsychotic synergism exerts its clinical efficacy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Negative symptoms are among the most chronic symptoms of schizophrenia. Even with the advent of atypical antipsychotic drugs, negative symptoms remain mostly refractory to treatment. It has been proposed that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) augmentation therapy in schizophrenia could provide a greater relief of these symptoms. Published studies, however promising, have produced conflicting results.
OBJECTIVE: To overcome this discrepancy in results, we performed a meta-analysis of studies assessing SSRI add-on therapy for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: A search was performed using the computerized search engines PsycINFO, PubMed (MEDLINE), and Current Contents. Keywords used were schizophrenia and (for SSRI) sertraline, citalopram, paroxetine, fluoxetine, and fluvoxamine. Hand search of published review articles as well as cross-referencing were carried out, too. Pharmaceutical companies were also contacted. Studies were retained if (1) SSRI add-on therapy was compared with antipsychotic monotherapy among schizophrenia-spectrum disorder patients; (2) the clinical trial was randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled with parallel-arm design; (3) negative symptoms were assessed with the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-negative subscale.
DATA EXTRACTION: With a consensus, authors (A.A.S. and S.P.) extracted and checked the data independently on the basis of predetermined exclusion and inclusion criteria. Effect size estimates were calculated using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Eleven studies responded to our inclusion criteria. Within a random-effects model, a nonsignificant composite effect size estimate for (end point) negative symptoms was obtained (N = 393; adjusted Hedges' g = 0.178; p = .191). However, when studies were divided according to severity of illness, a moderate and significant effect size emerged for the studies involving so-called "chronic patients" (N = 274; adjusted Hedges' g = 0.386; p = .014).
CONCLUSION: The current meta-analysis provides no global support for an improvement in negative symptoms with SSRI augmentation therapy in schizophrenia.},

AIMS: To analyse the efficacy of add-on antidepressants for the treatment of negative symptoms of chronic schizophrenia.
METHOD: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing the effect of antidepressants and placebo on the negative symptoms of chronic schizophrenia, measured through standardised rating scales. Outcome was measured as standardised mean difference between end-of-trial and baseline scores of negative symptoms.
RESULTS: There were 23 trials from 22 publications (n = 819). The antidepressants involved were selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mirtazapine, reboxetine, mianserin, trazodone and ritanserin; trials on other antidepressants were not available. The overall standardised mean difference was moderate (-0.48) in favour of antidepressants and subgroup analysis revealed significant responses for fluoxetine, trazodone and ritanserin.
CONCLUSIONS: Antidepressants along with antipsychotics are more effective in treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia than antipsychotics alone.},

Depressive and negative symptoms (primary outcomes), overall symptoms, positive symptoms, side effects, exacerbation of psychosis, and responder rates were examined. Subgroup, meta-regression, and sensitivity analyses were performed, as well as investigations of publication bias and risk of bias.
RESULTS: Eighty-two randomized controlled trials with a total of 3,608 participants were included. Add-on antidepressants appeared more efficacious than controls for depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference: -0.25, 95\% CI=-0.38 to -0.12), negative symptoms (standardized mean difference: -0.30, 95\% CI=-0.44 to -0.16), overall symptoms (standardized mean difference: -0.24, 95\% CI=-0.39 to -0.09), positive symptoms (standardized mean difference: -0.17, 95\% CI=-0.33 to -0.01), quality of life (standardized mean difference: -0.32, 95\% CI=-0.57 to -0.06), and responder rate (risk ratio: 1.52, 95\% CI=1.29 to 1.78; number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit: 5, 95\% CI=4 to 7). The effects on depressive and negative symptoms appeared more pronounced when minimum thresholds of these symptoms were inclusion criteria (standardized mean difference: -0.34, 95\% CI=-0.58 to -0.09 and standardized mean difference: -0.58, 95\% CI=-0.94 to -0.21, respectively). There were no significant differences between antidepressants and controls in terms of exacerbation of psychosis, premature discontinuation, and the number of participants with at least one adverse event. More patients taking add-on antidepressants suffered from abdominal pain, constipation, dizziness, and dry mouth.
CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of primary outcomes (depressive and negative symptoms) suggests small, beneficial effects of adjunctive antidepressants. It would appear that this augmentation can be accomplished with a low risk of exacerbation of psychosis and adverse effects. However, secondary and subgroup analyses should be interpreted cautiously and considered exploratory.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials of mirtazapine for the treatment of antipsychotic-induced acute akathisia (AIAA).
METHODS: Studies were identified using online searches of PUBMED/MEDLINE and Cochrane database (CENTRAL), along with websites recording trial information such as www.clinicaltrials.gov, www.controlled-trials.com, and www.clinicalstudyresults.org. The study eligibility criteria were randomized, double-blind clinical trials comparing mirtazapine with placebo for AIAA with standardized rating for akathisia as outcome measure. The methodological quality of included trials was assessed using the Jadad Scale. Separate meta-analyses were undertaken for each outcome (response rate and complete remission) and treatment effects were expressed as Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio (RR). Fixed-effect meta-analysis was performed as heterogeneity was not significant. Number need to treat (NNT) as a measure of relative treatment effectiveness was calculated.
RESULTS: A systematic review of the literature revealed six studies that had assessed mirtazapine for the treatment of AIAA. Of these, two studies (n = 86) met the review inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. A meta-analysis was performed to see the effect size of response rate and complete remission. For response rate, RR was 6.67 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.14-20.78], favoring mirtazapine compared with placebo, and the overall effect was significant (p = 0.001, NNT 4, 95\% CI 2.6-8.6). For complete remission, RR was 6.20 (95\% CI 1.74-22.08), favoring mirtazapine compared with placebo, and the overall effect was significant (p = 0.005, NNT 5, 95\% CI 2.9-11.6).
CONCLUSIONS: Although limited to only two studies and small sample, existing data support the efficacy of mirtazapine for the treatment of AIAA, with one in four patients showing partial response and one in five patients showing complete remission.},

A systematic review was conducted of PubMed, Cochrane Library and PsycINFO in December 2012 and meta-analyses of double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trials were performed. Standardized mean difference (SMD), risk ratio (RR), number-needed-to-treat (NNT), number-needed-to-harm (NNH) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results were across 12 studies and 362 patients were included (mirtazapine: seven trials and 221 patients; mianserin: five trials and 141 patients). NaSSA augmentation therapy was superior to placebo in overall symptoms (S.M.D. = -0.75, CI -1.24 to -0.26, p = 0.003, N = 11, n = 301), negative symptoms (S.M.D. = -0.88, CI -1.41 to -0.34, p = 0.001, N = 9, n = 240) and response rate (RR = 0.71, CI 0.57-0.88, p = 0.002, NNT = 4, p{\textless}0.00001, N = 6, n = 163). There was no significant difference in positive symptoms, depressive symptoms or discontinuation rate between NaSSAs and placebo treatments. In addition, no patients who received NaSSAs developed worsening psychosis during the study. For individual NaSSAs, mirtazapine was superior to placebo in overall symptoms (S.M.D. = 0.98, CI = -1.74 to -0.22, p = 0.01, N = 7, n = 194), negative symptoms (S.M.D. = -1.25, CI -1.88 to -0.62, p = 0.0001, N = 6, n = 172) and response rate (RR = 0.70, p = 0.04, NNT = 4, p = 0.0004, N = 4, n = 119). Moreover, NaSSAs were associated with reduced akathisia score (p {\textless} 0.00001) and extrapyramidal symptom scales (p = 0.01). However, NaSSAs caused drowsiness/sedation/somnolence compared with placebo (RR = 3.52, p = 0.002, NNT = 6, p = 0.01, N = 8, n = 209). Our results indicate that NaSSA (especially mirtazapine) augmentation therapy improved overall and negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Because the included studies were small, the results should be treated with caution.},

The study was an open-label prospective trial of 12 weeks' duration in which escitalopram at a dose of up to 20 mg/day was added to the existing antipsychotic drug regimen in schizophrenia patients with OCD. Fifteen patients (10 men/five women) with the diagnosis of schizophrenia and OCD were recruited for the study (mean age: 39±14, range 21-61 years) and received escitalopram according to the study design. A significant improvement was observed in the total Yale Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores and in the scores of both the Y-BOCS-Obsession and the Y-BOCS-Compulsion subscale at the end point. In addition, a significant improvement was observed in the total scores of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and particularly in scores of anxiety, tension, depression, and preoccupation items. No adverse effects of escitalopram were reported by patients during the trial. In our prospective 12-week open-label study, escitalopram 20 mg/day was well tolerated and improved OC symptoms in schizophrenia patients. Our preliminary results are encouraging and a double-blind randomized study is required to confirm our results.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Non-adherence is a major problem in the treatment of schizophrenia. Depot antipsychotic drugs are thought to reduce relapse rates by improving adherence, but a systematic review of long-term studies in outpatients is not available.
METHOD: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane reviews on depot medication, and the reference sections of included studies for randomised controlled trials lasting at least 12 months in outpatients that compared depot with oral antipsychotics in schizophrenia. Data on relapse (primary outcome), rehospitalisation, non-adherence, and dropout due to any reason, inefficacy of treatment and adverse events were summarised in a meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane collaboration's risk of bias tool, and publication bias with funnel plots.
RESULTS: Ten studies with 1700 participants met the inclusion criteria. Depot formulations significantly reduced relapses with relative and absolute risk reductions of 30\% and 10\%, respectively (RR 0.70, CI 0.57-0.87, NNT 10, CI 6-25, P=0.0009), and dropout due to inefficacy (RR 0.71, CI 0.57-0.89). Limited data on non-adherence, rehospitalisation and dropout due to any reason and adverse events revealed no significant differences. There were several potential sources of bias such as limited information on randomisation methods, problems of blinding and different medications in the depot and oral groups. Other studies reduced a potential superiority of depot by excluding non-adherent patients.
DISCUSSION: Depot antipsychotic drugs significantly reduced relapse. Due to a number of methodological problems in the single trials the evidence is, nonetheless, subject to possible bias.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relative effectiveness of second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic drugs as compared with that of older agents has been incompletely addressed, though newer agents are currently used far more commonly. We compared a first-generation antipsychotic, perphenazine, with several newer drugs in a double-blind study.
METHODS: A total of 1493 patients with schizophrenia were recruited at 57 U.S. sites and randomly assigned to receive olanzapine (7.5 to 30 mg per day), perphenazine (8 to 32 mg per day), quetiapine (200 to 800 mg per day), or risperidone (1.5 to 6.0 mg per day) for up to 18 months. Ziprasidone (40 to 160 mg per day) was included after its approval by the Food and Drug Administration. The primary aim was to delineate differences in the overall effectiveness of these five treatments.
RESULTS: Overall, 74 percent of patients discontinued the study medication before 18 months (1061 of the 1432 patients who received at least one dose): 64 percent of those assigned to olanzapine, 75 percent of those assigned to perphenazine, 82 percent of those assigned to quetiapine, 74 percent of those assigned to risperidone, and 79 percent of those assigned to ziprasidone. The time to the discontinuation of treatment for any cause was significantly longer in the olanzapine group than in the quetiapine (P{\textless}0.001) or risperidone (P=0.002) group, but not in the perphenazine (P=0.021) or ziprasidone (P=0.028) group. The times to discontinuation because of intolerable side effects were similar among the groups, but the rates differed (P=0.04); olanzapine was associated with more discontinuation for weight gain or metabolic effects, and perphenazine was associated with more discontinuation for extrapyramidal effects.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients in each group discontinued their assigned treatment owing to inefficacy or intolerable side effects or for other reasons. Olanzapine was the most effective in terms of the rates of discontinuation, and the efficacy of the conventional antipsychotic agent perphenazine appeared similar to that of quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone. Olanzapine was associated with greater weight gain and increases in measures of glucose and lipid metabolism.},

These guidelines are intended for use by all physicians seeing and treating people with schizophrenia. The data used for developing these guidelines have been extracted primarily from various national treatment guidelines and panels for schizophrenia, as well as from meta-analyses, reviews and randomised clinical trials on the efficacy of pharmacological and other biological treatment interventions identified by a search of the MEDLINE database and Cochrane Library. The identified literature was evaluated with respect to the strength of evidence for its efficacy and then categorised into four levels of evidence (A-D). This second part of the guidelines covers the long-term treatment as well as the management of relevant side effects. These guidelines are primarily concerned with the biological treatment (including antipsychotic medication, other pharmacological treatment options, electroconvulsive therapy, adjunctive and novel therapeutic strategies) of adults suffering from schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although continuous treatment with antipsychotics is still recommended as the gold standard treatment paradigm for all patients with schizophrenia, some clinicians question whether continuous antipsychotic treatment is necessary, or even justified, for every patient with schizophrenia who has been stabilized on antipsychotics.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis were (i) to compare relapse/hospitalization risks of stabilized patients with schizophrenia under active versus intermittent or placebo treatment conditions; (ii) to examine the role of several study characteristics, possibly intervening in the relationship between relapse risk and treatment condition; and (iii) to examine whether time to relapse is associated with antipsychotic treatment duration.
METHODS: A systematic literature search, using the MEDLINE database (1950 until November 2014), was conducted for English-language published randomized controlled trials, covering a follow-up time period of at least 6 months, and investigating relapse/rehospitalization and/or time-to-relapse rates with placebo or intermittent treatment strategies versus continuous treatment with oral and long-acting injectable first- or second-generation antipsychotics (FGAs/SGAs) in stabilized patients with schizophrenia. Additional studies were identified through searches of reference lists of other identified systematic reviews and Cochrane reports. Two meta-analyses (placebo versus continuous and intermittent versus continuous treatment) were performed to obtain an optimal estimation of the relapse/hospitalization risks of stabilized patients with schizophrenia under these treatment conditions and to assess the role of study characteristics. For time-to-relapse data, a descriptive analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Forty-eight reports were selected as potentially eligible for our meta-analysis. Of these, 21 met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-five records, identified through Cochrane and other systematic reviews and fulfilling the inclusion criteria, were added, resulting in a total of 46 records. Stabilized patients with schizophrenia who have been exposed for at least 6 months to intermittent or placebo strategies, respectively, have a 3 (odds ratio [OR] 3.36; 95\% CI 2.36-5.45; p {\textless} 0.0001) to 6 (OR 5.64; 95\% CI 4.47-7.11; p {\textless} 0.0001) times increased risk of relapse, compared with patients on continuous treatment. The availability of rescue medication (p = 0.0102) was the only study characteristic explaining systematic differences in the OR for relapse between placebo versus continuous treatment across studies. Studies reporting time-to-relapse data show that the time to (impending) relapse is always significantly delayed with continuous treatment, compared with placebo or intermittent treatment strategies. Although the interval between treatment discontinuation and symptom recurrence can be highly variable, mean time-to-relapse data seem to indicate a failure of clinical stability before 7-14 months with intermittent and before 5 months with placebo treatment strategies. For all reports included in this systematic review, median time-to-relapse rates in the continuous treatment group were not estimable as {\textless}50\% of the patients in this treatment condition relapsed before the end of the study.
CONCLUSIONS: With continuous treatment, patients have a lower risk of relapse and remain relapse free for a longer period of time compared with placebo and intermittent treatment strategies. Moreover, 'success rates' in the intermittent treatment conditions are expected to be an overestimate of actual outcome rates. Therefore, continuous treatment remains the 'gold standard' for good clinical practice, particularly as, until now, only a few and rather general valid predictors for relapse in schizophrenia are known and subsequent relapses may contribute to functional deterioration as well as treatment resistance in patients with schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {Antipsychotic drugs temper psychotic symptoms by interacting with dopamine D2 receptors to reduce dopamine neurotransmission. Currently, the standard of care involves antipsychotic treatment protocols that achieve steady-state levels of medication. Maintaining patients on continuous treatment is thought to be necessary to keep them stabilised. However, continuous antipsychotic exposure increases the risk of adverse effects over time. These effects include metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, extrapyramidal complications, and dopamine receptor supersensitivity, the latter of which could potentially promote both treatment tolerance and psychosis relapse. In the present review, we describe evidence showing that continuous exposure to antipsychotic drugs can not only worsen long-term outcome, but-past acute phase treatment-it is also unnecessary to effectively manage schizophrenia symptoms. We also describe evidence that regular but extended dosing, allowing predictable periods of lower antipsychotic levels/D2 occupancy, is both safe and effective in patients, and it greatly reduces drug exposure overall. Studies in laboratory animals show that compared to continuous antipsychotic exposure, regular but extended dosing actually has superior antipsychotic-like efficacy, and it also substantially reduces the likelihood of both motor side effects and dopamine receptor supersensitivity. We propose that regular, but extended dosing should be considered in the long-term treatment of people with schizophrenia, because the available evidence suggests it can be just as effective as continuous treatment, while decreasing overall drug exposure and potentially reducing harmful side effects.},

The clinical picture usually resembles that of a retarded depression with strong neurasthenic and schizoid components. It frequently emerges after a patient has been discharged from the hospital and may often go unnoticed. When manifest, the syndrome is usually stable phenomenologically, is often lengthy, and may be resistant to all modalities of treatment. Postpsychotic depression is a relatively neglected clinical area despite the risk of suicide and prolonged suffering. Therapeutic perseverence purportedly can improve the patient's long-term prognosis, and the phenomenon itself may be favorable prognostic sign.

We first present details of two cases representative among 30 patients who discussed "loneliness" with their chief therapist. Then, in the Discussion, we classify the expressions of "loneliness" into four modes, taking "loneliness as isolation open to the other." In this phase, the patient strongly seeks a "deeply significant other" as a "partner for even a little protection against loneliness," and the therapist often assumes this role. This role is extremely important to the patient's passage through the early remission phase. We stress that the presence of this "partner for even a little protection against loneliness" is of great significance for the problems of subsequent progress or stagnation in the remission process, and the issue of ongoing deterioration as well.},

METHODS: Historic prospective study. Standardised assessments of course and outcome.
RESULTS: About 75\% traced. About 50\% of surviving cases had favourable outcomes, but there was marked heterogeneity across geographic centres. In regression models, early (2-year) course patterns were the strongest predictor of 15-year outcome, but recovery varied by location; 16\% of early unremitting cases achieved late-phase recovery.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of treated incident cases of schizophrenia achieve favourable long-term outcome. Sociocultural conditions appear to modify long-term course. Early intervention programmes focused on social as well as pharmacological treatments may realise longer-term gains.},

We highlight the current state of the art in our understanding of emotional dysregulation in SCZ versus MD by focusing on broad domains of behavioral function that can map onto underlying neural systems, namely deficits in hedonics, anticipatory behaviors, computations underlying value and effort, and effortful goal-directed behaviors needed to pursue rewarding outcomes. We highlight unique disturbances in each disorder that may involve dissociable neural systems, but also possible interactions between affect and cognition in MD versus SCZ. Finally, we review computational and translational approaches that offer mechanistic insight into how cellular-level disruptions can lead to complex affective disturbances, informing development of therapies across MD and SCZ.},

It has been suggested that this disjunction between the experience and expression of emotion may reflect problems with the regulation of emotional expression. The present study thus set out to examine the capacity to engage in particular emotion regulatory strategies, and specifically, the ability to amplify the emotional expression of an experienced emotion ('amplification') or suppress the emotional expression of an experienced emotion ('suppression') whilst watching film clips selected to elicit amusement. Twenty nine participants with schizophrenia and 30 demographically matched non-clinical controls were asked to watch three different amusing film clips, whilst engaging in different regulatory strategies. The results indicate that participants with schizophrenia have difficulties with the amplification (but not suppression) of emotion expressive behavior. These difficulties are significantly correlated with total negative symptoms experienced, particularly emotional blunting.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Post-psychotic depression (PPD) is an important and frequent clinical phenomenon featuring controversial complexity in its nosological and aetiopathogenic cataloguing.
OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this research was to review the published literature on PPD. The second objective was to indicate its clinical importance, either comorbid or as an entity of its own. To answer these questions, a historical review of the term is made and a search about the clinical, evolutionary, predisposal, and prognostic variables that characterize the PPD.
METHODS: The international recommendations were followed according to the Preferred Items for Reporting of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The databases used were Web of Science and PubMed, with the deadline for the inclusion of articles in November 2019. The MeSH used were the following: "post" AND "psych *" AND "psich" AND "depr."
RESULTS: The search resulted in 64 articles. Only 19 of these met the pre-specified inclusion criteria and were finally included in the review. One article found that reading this literature was added due to its relevance. Despite its high prevalence (around 30\%), there is little research about the term PPD. Nevertheless, results show data to improve the description of the syndrome, revealing differential characteristics from other depressive symptoms in chronic psychosis due to its clinical implications.
CONCLUSIONS: Coinciding with the latest classification manuals that do not include the term, there appears to be an abandonment of its use despite its high prevalence. Data suggest that PPD is a nosological entity different from a secondary effect to antipsychotics, the negative symptoms of psychosis, and other clinical disorders that combine psychotic and depressive symptoms such as bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, or depression with psychotic symptoms. PPD also has differential characteristics concerning further depressive symptoms, especially important clinical implications such as higher suicide risk and poorer quality of life.},

	abstract = {Suicide is a major cause of death among patients with schizophrenia. Research indicates that at least 5-13\% of schizophrenic patients die by suicide, and it is likely that the higher end of range is the most accurate estimate. There is almost total agreement that the schizophrenic patient who is more likely to commit suicide is young, male, white and never married, with good premorbid function, post-psychotic depression and a history of substance abuse and suicide attempts. Hopelessness, social isolation, hospitalization, deteriorating health after a high level of premorbid functioning, recent loss or rejection, limited external support, and family stress or instability are risk factors for suicide in patients with schizophrenia. Suicidal schizophrenics usually fear further mental deterioration, and they experience either excessive treatment dependence or loss of faith in treatment. Awareness of illness has been reported as a major issue among suicidal schizophrenic patients, yet some researchers argue that insight into the illness does not increase suicide risk. Protective factors play also an important role in assessing suicide risk and should also be carefully evaluated. The neurobiological perspective offers a new approach for understanding self-destructive behavior among patients with schizophrenia and may improve the accuracy of screening schizophrenics for suicide. Although, there is general consensus on the risk factors, accurate knowledge as well as early recognition of patients at risk is still lacking in everyday clinical practice. Better knowledge may help clinicians and caretakers to implement preventive measures. This review paper is the result of a joint effort between researchers in the field of suicide in schizophrenia. Each expert provided a brief essay on one specific aspect of the problem. This is the first attempt to present a consensus report as well as the development of a set of guidelines for reducing suicide risk among schizophrenia patients.},

Although the benefit of the adjunctive antidepressant strategy was still observable in the total sample, as calculated by the prospectively intended data analysis, the findings were weaker than those obtained for the initial cohort. Owing to the possibility that differences between the later and earlier cohorts might account for the muted nature of the benefit, a post-hoc analysis was undertaken. This revealed that the later cohort was sicker in general and more psychotic in particular. The later cohort was also treated with lower doses of neuroleptic medication while remaining out of hospital longer, consistent with more recent treatment trends. It was also possible that the later cohort was subtly selected for more refractoriness of depression, since treatment of post-psychotic depression with adjunctive antidepressants had become more commonplace, and patients responding to this in general practice would not have gone on to be referred to the study. Thus a benefit from adjunctive antidepressant medication persists, but more remains to be learned about its character and likelihood in specific situations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research evidence supports the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy in the treatment of drug-refractory positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Although the cumulative evidence is strong, early controlled trials showed methodological limitations.
METHODS: A randomized controlled design was used to compare the efficacy of manualized cognitive-behavioral therapy developed particularly for schizophrenia with that of a nonspecific befriending control intervention. Both interventions were delivered by 2 experienced nurses who received regular supervision. Patients were assessed by blind raters at baseline, after treatment (lasting up to 9 months), and at a 9-month follow-up evaluation. Patients continued to receive routine care throughout the study. An assessor blind to the patients' treatment groups rated the technical quality of audiotaped sessions chosen at random. Analysis was by intention to treat.
RESULTS: Ninety patients received a mean of 19 individual treatment sessions over 9 months, with no significant between-group differences in treatment duration. Both interventions resulted in significant reductions in positive and negative symptoms and depression. At the 9-month follow-up evaluation, patients who had received cognitive therapy continued to improve, while those in the befriending group did not. These results were not attributable to changes in prescribed medication.
CONCLUSION: Cognitive-behavioral therapy is effective in treating negative as well as positive symptoms in schizophrenia resistant to standard antipsychotic drugs, with its efficacy sustained over 9 months of follow-up.},
