              Advances in genotyping technologies and high throughput
              sequencing, increasing analytic rigour and collaborative efforts
              on a global scale have generated a profusion of new findings. The
              broad conclusions from these studies are threefold: (1)
              schizophrenia is a highly polygenic disorder with a complex array
              of contributing risk loci across the allelic frequency spectrum;
              (2) many psychiatric illnesses share risk genes and alleles,
              specifically, schizophrenia has substantial overlaps with bipolar
              disorder, intellectual disability, major depressive disorder and
              autism spectrum disorders; and (3) some convergent biological
              themes are emerging from studies of schizophrenia and related
              disorders. In this commentary, we focus on the very recent
              findings that have emerged in the past 12 months, and in
              particular, the areas of convergence that are beginning to emerge

              Towards that end study status and study phase classifications

  abstract = "The discovery of neuroleptic drugs in 1952 provided a new
              strategy for seeking a biological basis of schizophrenia. This
              entailed a search for a primary site of neuroleptic action. The
              Parkinsonian effects caused by neuroleptics suggested that
              dopamine transmission may be disrupted by these drugs. In 1963 it
              was proposed that neuroleptics blocked ``monoamine receptors'' or
              impeded the release of monoamine metabolites. The neuroleptic
              concentration in plasma water or cerebrospinal fluid was of the
              order of 2 nM for haloperidol in clinical therapy. A systematic
              research was made between 1963 and 1974 for a primary site of
              neuroleptic action which would be sensitive to 2 nM haloperidol
              and stereoselective for (+)-butaclamol. Direct evidence that
              neuroleptics selectively blocked dopamine receptors occurred in
              1974 with the finding that nanomolar concentrations of these
              drugs stereoselectively inhibited the binding of [3H]-dopamine or
              [3H]-haloperidol. These binding sites, now termed D2 dopamine
              receptors (which inhibit adenylate cyclase), are blocked by
              neuroleptics in direct relation to the antipsychotic potencies of
              the neuroleptics. No such correlation exists for D1 receptors
              (which stimulate adenylate cyclase). Based on the fact that
              dopamine-mimetic drugs elicited hallucinations, and that
              neuroleptics caused rigidity, Van Rossum in 1966 had suggested a
              hypothesis that dopamine pathways may be overactive in
              schizophrenia. The D2-selective blockade by all neuroleptics
              (except the monoamine-depleting reserpine) provided strong
              support for the dopamine hypothesis. Further support now comes
              from postmortem data and in vivo positron tomographic data, both
              of which indicate that the density of D2 receptors are elevated
              in the schizophrenic brain. The postmortem data indicate a
              bimodal pattern with half the schizophrenics having striatal D2
              densities of 14 pmol/g (control is 13 pmol/g) and the other half
              having 26 pmol/g. Current positron tomographic data indicate D2
              densities of 14 pmol/g in control subjects, but values of 34
              pmol/g in drug-naive schizophrenics. Future tests of the dopamine
              hypothesis of schizophrenia may entail an examination of the
              amino acid composition and genes for D2 receptors in
              schizophrenic tissue, an examination of the ability of the D2
              receptor to become phosphorylated and to desensitize into the
              low-affinity state, and an examination of the interaction of D2
              receptors with D1 receptors or other neurotransmitters.",

              comparisons of drugs. We did a systematic review with pairwise
              and network meta-analyses of efficacy and tolerability. METHODS:
              We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, PubMed,
              Biosis, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomised controlled trials
              of antipsychotics for the acute treatment of first-episode
              schizophrenia, published up to Nov 17, 2016. Our primary outcome
              was overall change in symptoms. Secondary outcomes were change in
              positive and negative symptoms, categorical response to
              treatment, study dropout for any reason and for inefficacy of
              treatment, use of drugs to treat parkinsonian symptoms, weight
              gain, sedation, increase in prolactin release, overall
              functioning, and quality of life. We did the meta-analyses with a
              random-effects model to calculate standardised mean differences
              (SMDs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% CIs. FINDINGS: We
              identified 19 relevant randomised controlled trials of 12
              antipsychotic drugs that involved 2669 participants. 13 of the
              studies presented data on the primary outcome. For overall
              reduction of symptoms, amisulpride (SMD -0·37, 95\% CI -0·61 to
              -0·14), olanzapine (-0·25, -0·39 to -0·12), ziprasidone (-0·25,
              -0·48 to -0·01), and risperidone (-0·14, -0·27 to -0·01) were
              significantly more efficacious than haloperidol, but the evidence
              was very low to moderate quality. Amisulpride was superior for
              reduction of symptoms to quetiapine (SMD -0·25, 95\% CI -0·50 to
              -0·01). Olanzapine was superior to haloperidol and risperidone
              for reduction of negative symptoms. Several second-generation
              antipsychotics were superior to haloperidol in terms of all-cause
              discontinuation. Olanzapine was associated with at least one use
              of drugs to treat parkinsonian symptoms and quetiapine with less
              akathisia than haloperidol, aripiprazole, risperidone, and
              olanzapine, but, again, evidence was very low to low quality.
              Molindone was superior to risperidone, haloperidol, and
              olanzapine in terms of weight gain, and superior to risperidone
              in terms of increase in prolactin release. INTERPREATION:
              Haloperidol seems to be a suboptimum treatment option for acute
              treatment of first-episode schizophrenia, but we found little
              difference between second-generation antipsychotics. The evidence
              was generally of low quality and the numbers of patients for each
              drug were small. Thus, the choice of treatment should be guided
              primarily by side-effects. FUNDING: German Federal Ministry of

              of pharmacological or psychosocial interventions. Studies on the
              subsequent treatment steps, which are essential to guide
              clinicians, are largely missing. This knowledge gap leaves
              important questions unanswered. For example, when a first
              antipsychotic failed, is switching to another drug effective? And
              when should we use clozapine? The aim of this article is to
              review the efficacy of switching antipsychotics in case of
              nonresponse. We also present the European Commission sponsored
              ``Optimization of Treatment and Management of Schizophrenia in
              Europe'' (OPTiMiSE) trial which aims to provide a treatment
              algorithm for patients with a first episode of schizophrenia.
              METHODS: We searched Pubmed (October 29, 2014) for randomized
              controlled trials (RCTs) that examined switching the drug in
              nonresponders to another antipsychotic. We described important
              methodological choices of the OPTiMiSE trial. RESULTS: We found
              10 RCTs on switching antipsychotic drugs. No trial was conclusive
              and none was concerned with first-episode schizophrenia. In
              OPTiMiSE, 500 first episode patients are treated with amisulpride
              for 4 weeks, followed by a 6-week double-blind RCT comparing
              continuation of amisulpride with switching to olanzapine and
              ultimately a 12-week clozapine treatment in nonremitters. A
              subsequent 1-year RCT validates psychosocial interventions to
              enhance adherence. DISCUSSION: Current literature fails to
              provide basic guidance for the pharmacological treatment of
              schizophrenia. The OPTiMiSE trial is expected to provide a basis

              beyond just controlling psychotic symptoms to include functional
              recovery. This report describes an approach to define and measure
              the clinical effectiveness of treatment in achieving these
              objectives. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review
              established that there is limited information about the meaning
              of the term ``clinical effectiveness.'' To address this gap a
              consensus conference of schizophrenia researchers was held to
              consider the components of clinical effectiveness in real-world
              community practice and how these components can best be measured.
              RESULTS: The consensus of the researchers was that effective
              clinical treatment is characterized by four outcome domains:
              symptoms of disease, treatment burden, disease burden, and health
              and wellness. A clinical instrument to measure these four domains
              was constructed: Global Outcome Assessment of Life in
              Schizophrenia (GOALS). In using GOALS, clinicians rate each of
              the four domains on a scale of 1, very much improved, to 7, very
              much worse. Field-testing of this instrument is planned.
              CONCLUSIONS: Effective treatment interventions that combine
              optimal pharmacotherapy and targeted psychosocial treatments are
              raising expectations about the prospects of functional recovery
              among patients with schizophrenia. GOALS is proposed as one tool
              that can provide busy clinicians with a simple, objective measure
              of the effectiveness and outcomes of the clinical treatment they
              provide to patients with schizophrenia.",

              is routinely used to select treatments with higher efficacy and

              by which the criteria were developed; and traces the influence
              the criteria had on subsequent developments in American
              psychiatry. In the 1950s, when American psychiatry under
              psychoanalytic dominance had little interest in psychiatric
              diagnosis, Edwin Gildea recruited to the Department of Psychiatry
              at Washington University faculty who advocated a medical model
              for psychiatry in which diagnosis had a central role. In 1967, at
              the urging of the then-resident John Feighner, a discussion group
              led by Eli Robins and including Sam Guze, George Winokur, Robert
              Woodruff, and Rod Mu{\~n}oz began meeting with the initial goal
              of writing a review of prior key contributions to psychiatric
              diagnosis. In their meetings over the next year, the task soon
              shifted to the development of a set of new diagnostic criteria.
              For three diagnoses, major depression, antisocial personality
              disorder, and alcoholism, the authors could identify the original
              criteria from which this group worked and the rationale for many
              of the changes they introduced. Published in 1972, the Feighner
              criteria were soon widely cited and used in research, and they
              formed the basis for the development of the Research Diagnostic
              Criteria, which in turn were central to the development of
              DSM-III. The team that developed the Feighner criteria made three
              key contributions to psychiatry: the systematic use of
              operationalized diagnostic criteria; the reintroduction of an
              emphasis on illness course and outcome; and an emphasis on the
              need, whenever possible, to base diagnostic criteria on empirical

              evidence in the pharmacologic treatment of schizophrenia. The
              goal of the consensus conference was to update and revise the
              Texas Medication Algorithm Project (TMAP) algorithm for
              schizophrenia used in the Texas Implementation of Medication
              Algorithms, a statewide quality assurance program for treatment
              of major psychiatric illness. METHOD: Four questions were
              identified via premeeting teleconferences. (1) Should
              antipsychotic treatment of first-episode schizophrenia be
              different from that of multiepisode schizophrenia? (2) In which
              algorithm stages should first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) be
              an option? (3) How many antipsychotic trials should precede a
              clozapine trial? (4) What is the status of augmentation
              strategies for clozapine? Subgroups reviewed the evidence in each
              area and presented their findings at the conference. RESULTS: The
              algorithm was updated to incorporate the following
              recommendations. (1) Persons with first-episode schizophrenia
              typically require lower antipsychotic doses and are more
              sensitive to side effects such as weight gain and extrapyramidal
              symptoms (group consensus). Second-generation antipsychotics
              (SGAs) are preferred for treatment of first-episode schizophrenia
              (majority opinion). (2) FGAs should be included in algorithm
              stages after first episode that include SGAs other than clozapine
              as options (group consensus). (3) The recommended number of
              trials of other antipsychotics that should precede a clozapine
              trial is 2, but earlier use of clozapine should be considered in
              the presence of persistent problems such as suicidality, comorbid
              violence, and substance abuse (group consensus). (4) Augmentation
              is reasonable for persons with inadequate response to clozapine,
              but published results on augmenting agents have not identified
              replicable positive results (group consensus). CONCLUSIONS: These
              recommendations are meant to provide a framework for clinical
              decision making, not to replace clinical judgment. As with any
              algorithm, treatment practices will evolve beyond the
              recommendations of this consensus conference as new evidence and
              additional medications become available.",

  abstract = "Chemical signalling is the main mechanism by which biological
              function is controlled at all levels, from the single cell to the
              whole organism. Chemical recognition is the function of
              receptors, which, in addition to recognising endogenous chemical
              signals, are also the target of many important experimental and
              therapeutic drugs. Receptors, therefore, lie at the heart of
              pharmacology. This article describes the way in which the
              receptor concept originated early in the 20th century, and
              evolved through a highly innovative stage of quantitative theory
              based on chemical kinetics, to the point where receptors were
              first isolated and later cloned, until we now have a virtually
              complete catalogue of all the receptors present in the genome.
              Studies on signal transduction are revealing great complexity in
              the events linking ligand binding to the physiological or
              therapeutic response. Though some simple quantitative rules of
              'receptor theory' are still useful, the current emphasis is on
              unravelling the pathways that link receptors to responses, and it
              will be some time before we know enough about them to embark on
              the next phase of 'receptor theory'.",

              considered the standard treatment. However, clozapine use has
              restrictions owing to its many adverse effects. Moreover, an
              increasing number of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of other
              antipsychotics have been published. OBJECTIVE: To integrate all
              the randomized evidence from the available antipsychotics used
              for treatment-resistant schizophrenia by performing a network
              meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, PsycINFO,
              PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, World
              Health Organization International Trial Registry, and
              clinicaltrials.gov were searched up to June 30, 2014. STUDY
              SELECTION: At least 2 independent reviewers selected published
              and unpublished single- and double-blind RCTs in
              treatment-resistant schizophrenia (any study-defined criterion)
              that compared any antipsychotic (at any dose and in any form of
              administration) with another antipsychotic or placebo. DATA
              EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: At least 2 independent reviewers
              extracted all data into standard forms and assessed the quality
              of all included trials with the Cochrane Collaboration's
              risk-of-bias tool. Data were pooled using a random-effects model
              in a Bayesian setting. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary
              outcome was efficacy as measured by overall change in symptoms of
              schizophrenia. Secondary outcomes included change in positive and
              negative symptoms of schizophrenia, categorical response to
              treatment, dropouts for any reason and for inefficacy of
              treatment, and important adverse events. RESULTS: Forty blinded
              RCTs with 5172 unique participants (71.5\% men; mean [SD] age,
              38.8 [3.7] years) were included in the analysis. Few significant
              differences were found in all outcomes. In the primary outcome
              (reported as standardized mean difference; 95\% credible
              interval), olanzapine was more effective than quetiapine (-0.29;
              -0.56 to -0.02), haloperidol (-0. 29; -0.44 to -0.13), and
              sertindole (-0.46; -0.80 to -0.06); clozapine was more effective
              than haloperidol (-0.22; -0.38 to -0.07) and sertindole (-0.40;
              -0.74 to -0.04); and risperidone was more effective than
              sertindole (-0.32; -0.63 to -0.01). A pattern of superiority for
              olanzapine, clozapine, and risperidone was seen in other efficacy
              outcomes, but results were not consistent and effect sizes were
              usually small. In addition, relatively few RCTs were available
              for antipsychotics other than clozapine, haloperidol, olanzapine,
              and risperidone. The most surprising finding was that clozapine
              was not significantly better than most other drugs. CONCLUSIONS
              AND RELEVANCE: Insufficient evidence exists on which
              antipsychotic is more efficacious for patients with
              treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and blinded RCTs-in contrast
              to unblinded, randomized effectiveness studies-provide little
              evidence of the superiority of clozapine compared with other
              second-generation antipsychotics. Future clozapine studies with
              high doses and patients with extremely treatment-refractory
              schizophrenia might be most promising to change the current
              evidence.",

              classical Greeks (Alexandrian School), and which lasted, thanks
              to the work of Galen, until the sixteenth century (the theory of
              spiritus animalis); a second, purely mechanical one, developed on
              the basis of Cartesian conceptions, and which dominated in the

              Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) sponsored by the
              National Institute of Mental Health. CATIE was designed to
              compare a proxy first-generation antipsychotic, perphenazine, to
              several newer drugs. In phase 1 of the trial, consenting patients
              were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine, perphenazine,
              quetiapine, risperidone, or ziprasidone for up to 18 months on a
              double-blind basis. Patients with tardive dyskinesia were
              excluded from being randomly assigned to perphenazine and were
              assigned to one of the four second-generation antipsychotics in
              phase 1A. Clozapine was included in phase 2 of the study.
              Overall, olanzapine had the longest time to discontinuation in
              phase 1, but it was associated with significant weight and
              metabolic concerns. Perphenazine was not significantly different
              in overall effectiveness, compared with quetiapine, risperidone,
              and ziprasidone. Also, perphenazine was found to be the most
              cost-effective drug. Clozapine was confirmed as the most
              effective drug for individuals with a poor symptom response to
              previous antipsychotic drug trials, although clozapine was also
              associated with troublesome adverse effects. There were no

              poor response to an initial medication may mean that a different
              medication will be more effective or better tolerated. Although
              the CATIE results are controversial, they are broadly consistent
              with most previous antipsychotic drug trials and meta-analyses;
              however, the results may not generalize well to patients at high

              schizophrenia. RECENT FINDINGS: Using structural, diffusion,
              resting-state and task-related functional imaging and advanced
              computational analysis methods such as graph theory, more than
              200 publications have addressed different aspects of structural
              and/or functional connectivity in schizophrenia over the last
              year. These studies have focused on determining how brain
              networks differ from those in controls, interact with symptom
              profiles within and across diagnoses, interface with
              disease-related cognitive impairments and confer genetic risk for
              the disorder. SUMMARY: Much existing evidence supports the view
              that schizophrenia is a disorder of altered brain connectivity.
              Recent and continued characterization of the structural and
              functional connectome in schizophrenia patients have advanced our
              understanding of the neurobiology underlying clinical symptoms
              and cognitive impairments in a particular patient, their overlaps
              with other neuropsychiatric disorders sharing common features as
              well as the contributions of genetic risk factors. Although the
              clinical utility of the schizophrenia connectome remains to be
              realized, recent findings provide further promise that research
              in this area may lead to improved diagnosis, treatments and
              clinical outcomes.",

              {Treatment-Resistant} Depression in the United States",
  author   = "Ross, Eric L and Soeteman, Dj{\o}ra I",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of
              esketamine, a novel intranasally dosed antidepressant, for
              patients in the United States with treatment-resistant
              depression. METHODS: A decision-analytic model parameterized with
              efficacy data from phase 3 randomized trials of esketamine was
              used to simulate the effects of treatment with esketamine versus
              oral antidepressants over a 5-year horizon, from both societal
              and health care sector perspectives. Outcomes included remission
              and response of depression, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs),
              costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for
              esketamine. Value-based prices were calculated, defined as the
              per-dose price at which esketamine would become cost-effective
              given cost-effectiveness thresholds of $50,000/QALY,
              $100,000/QALY, and $150,000/QALY. Uncertainty in these outcomes
              was assessed with probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Key model
              parameters included the efficacy of esketamine versus oral
              antidepressants (relative risk of 1.39 for remission; 1.32 for
              response) and the monthly cost of esketamine ($5,572 for month 1;
              $1,699-$2,244 thereafter). RESULTS: Over 5 years, esketamine was
              projected to increase time in remission from 25.3\% to 31.1\% of
              life-years, resulting in a gain of 0.07 QALYs. Esketamine
              increased societal costs by $16,617 and health care sector costs
              by $16,995. Base case ICERs were $237,111/QALY (societal) and
              $242,496/QALY (health care sector). Probabilistic sensitivity
              analysis showed a greater than 95\% likelihood that esketamine's
              ICER would be above $150,000/QALY. At a cost-effectiveness
              threshold of $150,000/QALY, esketamine's value-based price was
              approximately $140/dose (versus a current price of $240/dose).
              CONCLUSIONS: Esketamine is unlikely to be cost-effective for
              management of treatment-resistant depression in the United States
              unless its price falls by more than 40\%.",

              more expensive than first-generation (typical) antipsychotics
              (FGAs) but are perceived to be more effective, with fewer adverse
              effects, and preferable to patients. Most evidence comes from
              short-term efficacy trials of symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To test the
              hypothesis that in people with schizophrenia requiring a change
              in treatment, SGAs other than clozapine are associated with
              improved quality of life across 1 year compared with FGAs.
              DESIGN: A noncommercially funded, pragmatic, multisite,
              randomized controlled trial of antipsychotic drug classes, with
              blind assessments at 12, 26, and 56 weeks using
              intention-to-treat analysis. SETTING: Fourteen community
              psychiatric services in the English National Health Service.
              PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred twenty-seven people aged 18 to 65 years
              with DSM-IV schizophrenia and related disorders assessed for
              medication review because of inadequate response or adverse
              effects. INTERVENTIONS: Randomized prescription of either FGAs or
              SGAs (other than clozapine), with the choice of individual drug
              made by the managing psychiatrist. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality
              of Life Scale scores, symptoms, adverse effects, participant
              satisfaction, and costs of care. RESULTS: The primary hypothesis
              of significant improvement in Quality of Life Scale scores during
              the year after commencement of SGAs vs FGAs was excluded.
              Participants in the FGA arm showed a trend toward greater
              improvements in Quality of Life Scale and symptom scores.
              Participants reported no clear preference for either drug group;
              costs were similar. CONCLUSIONS: In people with schizophrenia
              whose medication is changed for clinical reasons, there is no
              disadvantage across 1 year in terms of quality of life, symptoms,
              or associated costs of care in using FGAs rather than
              nonclozapine SGAs. Neither inadequate power nor patterns of drug

              procedures to elucidate the comparative efficacy and tolerability
              of second-generation antipsychotics. METHODS: Seven
              antipsychotics were selected based on the availability of the
              relevant data. Data were gathered from a series of review article
              published by the Cochrane Collaboration. Six outcome measures
              were analyzed: 1) percentage of no clinically important response
              as defined by the original authors, 2) PANSS total score change
              from baseline to endpoint, 3) percentage of akathisia, 4)
              percentage of antiparkinson medication use, 5) percentage of
              total body weight increase more than 7\%, and 6) percentage of
              drop-out due to any reasons. RESULTS: All the second-generation
              antipsychotics included in this study showed fairly similar
              efficacy but widely different tolerability. In terms of efficacy,
              amisulpride, clozapine and olanzapine were ranked higher than
              aripiprazole, quetiapine and ziprasidone. Clozapine and
              olanzapine were superior in terms of akathisia and extrapyramidal
              symptom risk, but, far more prone to induce clinically important
              weight gain. CONCLUSION: Using MTC methodology, we could line up
              the second generation antipsychotics according to their
              hierarchical superiority in terms of efficacy and tolerability.

              between-individual Cox multivariate models. The adjusted hazard
              ratios (aHRs) for any somatic hospitalization and cardiovascular
              hospitalization were 1.00 (95\% CI: 0.98-1.03) and 1.00 (95\% CI:
              0.92-1.07) during use of any antipsychotic compared to
              non-exposure periods within the same individual. The aHRs were
              0.48 (95\% CI: 0.46-0.51) for all-cause mortality, 0.62 (95\% CI:
              0.57-0.67) for cardiovascular mortality, and 0.52 (95\% CI:
              0.43-0.62) for suicide mortality during use vs. non-use of any
              antipsychotic. The most beneficial mortality outcome was
              associated with use of clozapine in terms of all-cause (aHR=0.39,
              95\% CI: 0.36-0.43), cardiovascular (aHR=0.55, 95\% CI:
              0.47-0.64) and suicide mortality (aHR=0.21, 95\% CI: 0.15-0.29).
              The cumulative mortality rates during maximum follow-up of 20
              years were 46.2\% for no antipsychotic use, 25.7\% for any
              antipsychotic use, and 15.6\% for clozapine use. These data
              suggest that long-term antipsychotic use does not increase severe
              physical morbidity leading to hospitalization, and is associated
              with substantially decreased mortality, especially among patients

              medications and diagnostic methods for mental illnesses are not
              satisfying. In animal studies, stem cell therapy is promising for
              some neuropsychiatric disorders and cognitive/social deficits,
              not only treating during development (targeting modulation and
              balancing) but also following neurodegeneration (cell replacement
              and regenerating support). We believe that novel interventions
              such as modulation of particular cell populations to develop
              cell-based treatment can improve cognitive and social functions
              in SMI. With pathological synaptic/myelin damage,
              oligodendrocytes seem to play a role. In this review, we have
              summarized oligodendrogenesis mechanisms and some related calcium
              signals in neural cells and stem/progenitor cells. The related
              benefits from endogenous stem/progenitor cells within the brain
              and exogenous stem cells, including multipotent
              mesenchymal-derived stromal cells (MSC), fetal neural stem cells
              (NSC), pluripotent stem cells (PSC), and differentiated
              progenitors, are discussed. These also include stimulating
              mechanisms of oligodendrocyte proliferation, maturation, and
              myelination, responsive to the regenerative effects by both
              endogenous stem cells and transplanted cells. Among the
              mechanisms, calcium signaling regulates the neuronal/glial
              progenitor cell (NPC/GPC)/oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC)
              proliferation, migration, and differentiation, dendrite
              development, and synaptic plasticity, which are involved in many
              neuropsychiatric diseases in human. On the basis of numerous
              protein annotation and protein-protein interaction databases, a
              total of 119 calcium-dependent/activated proteins that are
              related to neuropsychiatry in human are summarized in this
              investigation. One of the advanced methods, the
              calcium/cation-channel-optogenetics-based stimulation of stem
              cells and transplanted cells, can take advantage of calcium
              signaling regulations. Intranasal-to-brain delivery of drugs and
              stem cells or local delivery with the guidance of brain imaging
              techniques may provide a unique new approach for treating
              psychiatric disorders. It is also expected that preconditioning
              stem cell therapy following precise brain imaging as pathological
              confirmation has high potential if translated to cell clinic use.
              Generally, modulable cell transplantation followed by
              stimulations should provide paracrine protection, synaptic
              modulation, and myelin repair for the brain in SMI.",

              for schizophrenia are not well defined, but such information
              would be important for decision making by clinicians. The authors
              sought to fill this gap by conducting dose-response
              meta-analyses. METHODS: A search of multiple electronic databases
              (through November 2018) was conducted for all placebo-controlled
              dose-finding studies for 20 second-generation antipsychotic drugs
              and haloperidol (oral and long-acting injectable, LAI) in people
              with acute schizophrenia symptoms. Dose-response curves were
              constructed with random-effects dose-response meta-analyses and a
              spline model. The outcome measure was total score reduction from
              baseline on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale or the Brief
              Psychiatric Rating Scale. The authors identified 95\% effective
              doses, explored whether higher or lower doses than the currently
              licensed ones might be more appropriate, and derived dose
              equivalencies from the 95\% effective doses. RESULTS: Sixty-eight
              studies met the inclusion criteria. The 95\% effective doses and
              the doses equivalent to 1 mg of oral risperidone, respectively,
              were as follows: amisulpride for patients with positive symptoms,
              537 mg/day and 85.8 mg; aripiprazole, 11.5 mg/day and 1.8 mg;
              aripiprazole LAI (lauroxil), 463 mg every 4 weeks and 264 mg;
              asenapine, 15.0 mg/day and 2.4 mg; brexpiprazole, 3.36 mg/day and
              0.54 mg; haloperidol, 6.3 mg/day and 1.01 mg; iloperidone, 20.13
              mg/day and 3.2 mg; lurasidone, 147 mg/day and 23.5 mg;
              olanzapine, 15.2 mg/day and 2.4 mg; olanzapine LAI, 277 mg every
              2 weeks and 3.2 mg; paliperidone, 13.4 mg/day and 2.1 mg;
              paliperidone LAI, 120 mg every 4 weeks and 1.53 mg; quetiapine,
              482 mg/day and 77 mg; risperidone, 6.3 mg/day and 1 mg;
              risperidone LAI, 36.6 mg every 2 weeks and 0.42 mg; sertindole,
              22.5 mg/day and 3.6 mg; and ziprasidone, 186 mg/day and 30 mg.
              For amisulpride and olanzapine, specific data for patients with
              predominant negative symptoms were available. The authors have
              made available on their web site a spreadsheet with this method
              and other updated methods that can be used to estimate dose
              equivalencies in practice. CONCLUSIONS: In chronic schizophrenia
              patients with acute exacerbations, doses higher than the
              identified 95\% effective doses may on average not provide more
              efficacy. For some drugs, higher than currently licensed doses
              might be tested in further trials, because their dose-response

              the focus in pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia has shifted to the

              well-known drugs, which act on recently discovered treatment
              targets for cognitive enhancement, and which may complement the
              existing drugs. This might pave the way for personalized
              treatment regimens for patients with schizophrenia aimed at
              improved functional outcome. The review also aims at identifying

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The treatment of schizophrenia is challenging due to
              the wide range of symptoms (positive, negative, cognitive)
              associated with the disease. Typical antipsychotics that
              antagonize D2 receptors are effective in treating positive
              symptoms, but extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS) are a common
              occurrence. Atypical antipsychotics targeting 5-HT2A and D2
              receptors are more effective at treating cognitive and negative
              symptoms compared to typical antipsychotics, but these drugs also
              result in side-effects such as metabolic syndromes. OBJECTIVE: To
              identify evidence in the literature that elucidates the
              pharmacological profile of aripiprazole.s. METHODS: We searched
              PubMed for peer reviewed articles on aripiprazole and its
              clinical efficacy, side-effects, pharmacology, and effects in
              animal models of schizophrenia symptoms. RESULTS: Aripiprazole is
              a newer atypical antipsychotic that displays a unique
              pharmacological profile, including partial D2 agonism and
              functionally selective properties. Aripiprazole is effective at
              treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and has the
              potential to treat negative and cognitive symptoms at least as
              well as other atypical antipsychotics. The drug has a favorable
              side-effect profile and has a low propensity to result in EPS or
              metabolic syndromes. Animal models of schizophrenia have been
              used to determine the efficacy of aripiprazole in symptom
              management. In these instances, aripiprazole resulted in the
              reversal of deficits in extinction, pre-pulse inhibition, and
              social withdrawal. Because aripiprazole requires a greater than
              90\% occupancy rate at D2 receptors to be clinically active and
              does not produce EPS, this suggests a functionally selective
              effect on intracellular signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: A
              combination of factors such as dopamine system stabilization via
              partial agonism, functional selectivity at D2 receptors, and
              serotonin-dopamine system interaction may contribute to the
              ability of aripiprazole to successfully manage schizophrenia
              symptoms. This review examines these mechanisms of action to
              further clarify the pharmacological actions of aripiprazole.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Most studies comparing second generation
              antipsychotics with classical neuroleptics have been conducted in
              more or less chronic schizophrenia patients. Such studies were
              usually conducted in highly selected samples, and were generally
              designed and financed by the manufacturer of the drug tested.
              These and other facts have stimulated discussions regarding the
              effectiveness of the new generation of antipsychotics. AIMS: The
              aim of the European First Episode Schizophrenia Trial (EUFEST) is
              to compare treatment with amisulpride, quetiapine, olanzapine and
              ziprasidone to a low dose of haloperidol in an unselected sample
              of first episode schizophrenia patients with minimal prior
              exposure to antipsychotics. METHODS: 500 patients between the
              ages of 18-40 meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia,
              schizoaffective disorder or schizophreniform disorder are
              randomly allocated to one year of treatment with one of the drugs
              under study. The primary outcome measure is retention in
              treatment, defined as time to discontinuation of study drug. Loss
              of retention can be the result of insufficient clinical effect,
              or lack of tolerability or acceptance. Secondary measures include
              changes in different dimensions of psychopathology, side effects,
              compliance, social needs, quality of life, substance abuse and
              cognitive functions. CONCLUSIONS: At present, more than 400
              patients have been recruited and randomized in the following
              countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany,
              France, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Rumania, Spain,
              Sweden and Switzerland: The study should be finished by the end
              of 2006 and it is expected that results will yield relevant
              clinical information with regard to the effectiveness of the
              second generation antipsychotics. This effort represents the

  abstract = "Functional selectivity is the term that describes drugs that
              cause markedly different signaling through a single receptor
              (e.g., full agonist at one pathway and antagonist at a second).
              It has been widely recognized recently that this phenomenon
              impacts the understanding of mechanism of action of some drugs,
              and has relevance to drug discovery. One of the clinical areas
              where this mechanism has particular importance is in the
              treatment of schizophrenia. Antipsychotic drugs have been grouped
              according to both pattern of clinical action and mechanism of
              action. The original antipsychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine
              and haloperidol have been called typical or first generation.
              They cause both antipsychotic actions and many side effects
              (extrapyramidal and endocrine) that are ascribed to their high
              affinity dopamine D(2) receptor antagonism. Drugs such as
              clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone and others were then developed
              that avoided the neurological side effects (atypical or second
              generation antipsychotics). These compounds are divided
              mechanistically into those that are high affinity D(2) and
              5-HT(2A) antagonists, and those that also bind with modest
              affinity to D(2), 5-HT(2A), and many other neuroreceptors. There
              is one approved third generation drug, aripiprazole, whose
              actions have been ascribed alternately to either D(2) partial
              agonism or D(2) functional selectivity. Although partial agonism
              has been the more widely accepted mechanism, the available data
              are inconsistent with this mechanism. Conversely, the D(2)
              functional selectivity hypothesis can accommodate all current
              data for aripiprazole, and also impacts on discovery compounds
              that are not pure D(2) antagonists.",

  abstract = "Numerous double-blind studies have compared second-generation
              antipsychotics (SGAs) with first-generation antipsychotics
              (FGAs), with most finding better efficacy and tolerability for
              SGAs. However, these 'efficacy trials' were generally short term
              and included only highly selected patients. Mostly because of
              weight gain and other metabolic effects of the SGAs, as well as
              their high acquisition price, the debate on the (cost)
              effectiveness of the SGAs led to two pragmatic clinical trials
              with no sponsorship by industry. Both trials had broad inclusion
              criteria and long follow-up, and tried to mimic clinical routine:
              CATIE (Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention
              Effectiveness) and CUtLASS (Cost Utility of the Latest
              Antipsychotic drugs in Schizophrenia Study). 1493 patients
              participated in CATIE, an 18-month, double-blind trial comparing
              the SGAs olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone with
              the FGA perphenazine. If efficacy or tolerability was
              insufficient, patients were re-randomized to a medication other
              than the one they previously received. Improvement of
              psychopathology and of quality of life was only moderate.
              Overall, 74\% of patients discontinued study medication before 18
              months, and the median time to discontinuation was 4.6 months.
              Aside from olanzapine (time to discontinuation 9.2 months), the
              other SGAs did not differ from each other or from perphenazine.
              Except for adverse effects as a reason for discontinuation,
              differences between the SGAs and the FGA were minimal. In
              CUtLASS, a 12-month open-label trial, 277 patients were
              randomized to receive an FGA or a SGA. Again, efficacy was rather
              similar between the two groups, with only limited improvement of
              psychopathology and quality of life. The authors of both trials
              concluded that SGAs do not markedly differ from FGAs regarding
              compliance, quality of life and effectiveness. The methodological
              problems of both trials have been discussed extensively. Patients
              had psychotic symptoms that were moderate in severity and were at
              least partially treatment resistant. The marginal improvement
              observed indicated that this population might not be appropriate
              to detect differences between FGAs and SGAs. Specific issues of
              CATIE include the exclusion of patients with tardive dyskinesia
              in the perphenazine arm and the high discontinuation rate. In
              CUtLASS, the concept of including 13 different FGAs and four SGAs
              in the respective classes was problematic. It is of interest that
              the most widely prescribed drug was sulpiride--of the FGAs, this
              is probably the 'most atypical' drug. Aside from the finding that
              the advantages of the SGAs are not as strong as early trials and
              marketing suggested or promised, the trials do not provide much
              helpful information regarding everyday practice. For tardive
              dyskinesia, no conclusions at all can be drawn. Similarly,
              methodological problems inhibited the detection of the other
              major advantage of the SGAs, i.e. the improved subjective
              well-being/quality of life while receiving these agents. It is
              well known that patients' and doctors' perspectives differ
              markedly, and the Quality of Life Scale (QLS), an expert-rated
              scale used in both trials, might not be sensitive enough to
              detect the subjective advantages reported by the majority of
              patients in other trials. CATIE and CUtLASS suggest that SGAs do
              not live up to all the previous expectations. However, even if
              most of these advantages are debatable, the lower risk of tardive
              dyskinesia and the better subjective effects should be strong
              enough reasons to favour these drugs. There is no single
              antipsychotic that is best for every schizophrenia patient, as
              individual responses differ markedly. For successfully
              individualized treatment, a multitude of antipsychotic options
              are needed.",

              data and assessed the quality of the methods of the included
              meta-analyses using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic
              Reviews (AMSTAR), adding 6 new items to rate their quality.
              Effect sizes, expressed as standardized mean difference /Hedges g
              or risk ratio, were compared separately for combinations with any
              antipsychotic drug and for combinations with clozapine. Main
              Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was total symptom
              reduction. Secondary outcomes included positive and negative
              symptoms, treatment recommendations by authors, study-defined
              inefficacies, cognitive and depressive symptoms, discontinuation
              of treatment because of any cause, and inefficacies or
              intolerabilities. Results: Of 3397 publications, 29 meta-analyses
              testing 42 combination strategies in 381 individual trials and
              among 19 833 participants were included. For total symptom
              reductions, 32 strategies that augmented any antipsychotic drug
              and 5 strategies that augmented clozapine were examined. Fourteen
              combination treatments outperformed controls (standard mean
              difference/Hedges g, -1.27 [95\% CI, -2.35 to -0.19] to -0.23
              [95\% CI, -0.44 to -0.02]; P = .05). No combination strategies
              with clozapine outperformed controls. The quality of the methods
              of the meta-analyses was generally high (mean score, 9 of a
              maximum score of 11) but the quality of the meta-analyzed studies
              was low (mean score, 2.8 of a maximum score of 8). Treatment
              recommendations correlated with the effect size (correlation
              coefficient, 0.22; 95\% CI, 0.35-0.10; P < .001), yet effect
              sizes were inversely correlated with study quality (correlation
              coefficient, -0.06; 95\% CI, 0.01 to -0.12; P = .02). Conclusions
              and Relevance: Meta-analyses of 21 interventions fully or
              partially recommended their use, with recommendations being
              positively correlated with the effect sizes of the pooled
              intervention. However, the effect sizes were inversely correlated
              with meta-analyzed study quality, reducing confidence in these
              recommendations. Higher-quality trials and patient-based
              meta-analyses are needed to determine whether subpopulations
              might benefit from combination treatment, as no single strategy
              can be recommended for patients with schizophrenia based on the
              current meta-analytic literature.",

              Effectiveness (CATIE) study examined the comparative
              effectiveness of antipsychotic treatments for individuals with
              chronic schizophrenia. Patients who had discontinued
              antipsychotic treatment in phases 1 and 2 were eligible for phase
              3, in which they selected one of nine antipsychotic regimens with
              the help of their study doctor. We describe the characteristics
              of the patients who selected each treatment option and their
              outcomes. METHOD: Two hundred and seventy patients entered phase
              3. The open-label treatment options were monotherapy with oral
              aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, perphenazine, quetiapine,
              risperidone, ziprasidone, long-acting injectable fluphenazine
              decanoate, or a combination of any two of these treatments.
              RESULTS: Few patients selected fluphenazine decanoate (n=9) or
              perphenazine (n=4). Similar numbers selected each of the other
              options (range 33-41). Of the seven common choices, those who
              selected clozapine and combination antipsychotic treatment were
              the most symptomatic, and those who selected aripiprazole and
              ziprasidone had the highest body mass index. Symptoms improved
              for all groups, although the improvements were modest for the
              groups starting with relatively mild levels of symptoms. Side
              effect profiles of the medications varied considerably but
              medication discontinuations due to intolerability were rare (7\%
              overall). CONCLUSIONS: Patients and their doctors made treatment
              selections based on clinical factors, including severity of
              symptoms, response to prior treatments, and physical health
              status. Fluphenazine decanoate was rarely used among those with
              evidence of treatment non-adherence and clozapine was
              underutilized for those with poor previous response. Combination
              antipsychotic treatment warrants further study.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The relative effectiveness of second-generation
              (atypical) antipsychotic drugs as compared with that of older
              agents has been incompletely addressed, though newer agents are
              currently used far more commonly. We compared a first-generation
              antipsychotic, perphenazine, with several newer drugs in a
              double-blind study. METHODS: A total of 1493 patients with
              schizophrenia were recruited at 57 U.S. sites and randomly
              assigned to receive olanzapine (7.5 to 30 mg per day),
              perphenazine (8 to 32 mg per day), quetiapine (200 to 800 mg per
              day), or risperidone (1.5 to 6.0 mg per day) for up to 18 months.
              Ziprasidone (40 to 160 mg per day) was included after its
              approval by the Food and Drug Administration. The primary aim was
              to delineate differences in the overall effectiveness of these
              five treatments. RESULTS: Overall, 74 percent of patients
              discontinued the study medication before 18 months (1061 of the
              1432 patients who received at least one dose): 64 percent of
              those assigned to olanzapine, 75 percent of those assigned to
              perphenazine, 82 percent of those assigned to quetiapine, 74
              percent of those assigned to risperidone, and 79 percent of those
              assigned to ziprasidone. The time to the discontinuation of
              treatment for any cause was significantly longer in the
              olanzapine group than in the quetiapine (P<0.001) or risperidone
              (P=0.002) group, but not in the perphenazine (P=0.021) or
              ziprasidone (P=0.028) group. The times to discontinuation because
              of intolerable side effects were similar among the groups, but
              the rates differed (P=0.04); olanzapine was associated with more
              discontinuation for weight gain or metabolic effects, and
              perphenazine was associated with more discontinuation for
              extrapyramidal effects. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients in
              each group discontinued their assigned treatment owing to
              inefficacy or intolerable side effects or for other reasons.
              Olanzapine was the most effective in terms of the rates of
              discontinuation, and the efficacy of the conventional
              antipsychotic agent perphenazine appeared similar to that of
              quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone. Olanzapine was
              associated with greater weight gain and increases in measures of

              sources, and conclusions of 37 published reviews of research on
              effects of a model program. Study 2 compared findings of one
              published trial with summaries of results of that trial that
              appeared in published reviews. Results Study 1: Published reviews
              varied in terms of the transparency of inclusion criteria,
              strategies for locating relevant published and unpublished data,
              standards used to evaluate evidence, and methods used to
              synthesize results across studies. Most reviews relied solely on
              narrative analysis of a convenience sample of published studies.
              None of the reviews used systematic methods to identify, analyze,
              and synthesize results. Study 2: When results of a single study
              were traced from the original report to summaries in published
              reviews, three patterns emerged: a complex set of results was
              simplified, non-significant results were ignored, and positive
              results were over-emphasized. Most reviews used a single positive
              statement to characterize results of a study that were decidedly
              mixed. This suggests that reviews were influenced by confirmation
              bias, the tendency to emphasize evidence that supports a
              hypothesis and ignore evidence to the contrary. Conclusions

              concept of anhedonia, the loss of ability to experience pleasure.
              Its role in the diagnosis of melancholia was considered to be
              crucial. In the present century attention to anhedonia has faded,
              possibly because of the focus upon depressed mood as the
              pathognomonic feature of depressive disorders. Research on the
              symptomatology of endogenous depression did not include the
              concept; anhedonia was also lacking from the major instruments of
              psychiatric research, the depression rating scales, Attention was
              drawn to anhedonia by two authors: by Meehl in the 1960s and by
              Klein in the 1970s. Meehl considered anhedonia from the point of
              view of a personality defect predisposing to mental illness; and
              Klein regarded anhedonia to be a symptom of depressive illness
              and probably the best clinical marker predicting response to
              antidepressant drugs. In 1980 the revised DSM presented the
              concept of 'loss of interest or pleasure' as one of the two
              cardinal symptoms of major depression. Since then there has been
              a gradual recovery of emphasis although many systems confuse the
              two concepts of 'loss of interest' and anhedonia. It is possible
              that anhedonia may provide the key to a more exact delineation of
              depressive disorders in biological research and in clinical
              practice. Further research will depend upon a more precise,

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Second-generation antipsychotic drugs were introduced
              over a decade ago for the treatment of schizophrenia; however,
              their purported clinical effectiveness compared with
              first-generation antipsychotic drugs is still debated. We aimed
              to compare the effectiveness of second-generation antipsychotic
              drugs with that of a low dose of haloperidol, in first-episode
              schizophrenia. METHODS: We did an open randomised controlled
              trial of haloperidol versus second-generation antipsychotic drugs
              in 50 sites, in 14 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18-40
              years, and met diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia,
              schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. 498
              patients were randomly assigned by a web-based online system to
              haloperidol (1-4 mg per day; n=103), amisulpride (200-800 mg per
              day; n=104), olanzapine (5-20 mg per day; n=105), quetiapine
              (200-750 mg per day; n=104), or ziprasidone (40-160 mg per day;
              n=82); follow-up was at 1 year. The primary outcome measure was
              all-cause treatment discontinuation. Patients and their treating
              physicians were not blinded to the assigned treatment. Analysis
              was by intention to treat. This study is registered as an
              International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number
              ISRCTN68736636. FINDINGS: The number of patients who discontinued
              treatment for any cause within 12 months was 63 (Kaplan-Meier
              estimate 72\%) for haloperidol, 32 (40\%) for amisulpride, 30
              (33\%) for olanzapine, 51 (53\%) for quetiapine, and 31 (45\%)
              for ziprasidone. Comparisons with haloperidol showed lower risks
              for any-cause discontinuation with amisulpride (hazard ratio [HR]
              0.37, [95\% CI 0.24-0.57]), olanzapine (HR 0.28 [0.18-0.43]),
              quetiapine (HR 0.52 [0.35-0.76]), and ziprasidone (HR 0.51
              [0.32-0.81]). However, symptom reductions were virtually the same
              in all the groups, at around 60\%. INTERPRETATION: This pragmatic
              trial suggests that clinically meaningful antipsychotic treatment
              of first-episode of schizophrenia is achievable, for at least 1
              year. However, we cannot conclude that second-generation drugs
              are more efficacious than is haloperidol, since discontinuation
              rates are not necessarily consistent with symptomatic
              improvement.",

  abstract = "Antipsychotic polypharmacy in schizophrenia is much debated,
              since it is common and costly with unclear evidence for its
              efficacy and safety. We conducted a systematic literature search
              and a random effects meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing
              augmentation with a second antipsychotic vs. continued
              antipsychotic monotherapy in schizophrenia. Co-primary outcomes
              were total symptom reduction and study-defined response.
              Antipsychotic augmentation was superior to monotherapy regarding
              total symptom reduction (16 studies, N=694, standardized mean
              difference, SMD=-0.53, 95\% CI: -0.87 to -0.19, p=0.002).
              However, superiority was only apparent in open-label and
              low-quality trials (both p<0.001), but not in double-blind and
              high-quality ones (p=0.120 and 0.226, respectively).
              Study-defined response was similar between antipsychotic
              augmentation and monotherapy (14 studies, N=938, risk ratio =
              1.19, 95\% CI: 0.99 to 1.42, p=0.061), being clearly
              non-significant in double-blind and high-quality studies (both
              p=0.990). Findings were replicated in clozapine and non-clozapine
              augmentation studies. No differences emerged regarding
              all-cause/specific-cause discontinuation, global clinical
              impression, as well as positive, general and depressive symptoms.
              Negative symptoms improved more with augmentation treatment (18
              studies, N=931, SMD=-0.38, 95\% CI: -0.63 to -0.13, p<0.003), but
              only in studies augmenting with aripiprazole (8 studies, N=532,
              SMD=-0.41, 95\% CI: -0.79 to -0.03, p=0.036). Few adverse effect
              differences emerged: D2 antagonist augmentation was associated
              with less insomnia (p=0.028), but more prolactin elevation
              (p=0.015), while aripiprazole augmentation was associated with
              reduced prolactin levels (p<0.001) and body weight (p=0.030).
              These data suggest that the common practice of antipsychotic
              augmentation in schizophrenia lacks double-blind/high-quality
              evidence for efficacy, except for negative symptom reduction with
              aripiprazole augmentation.",

              is an observational, naturalistic study of the outpatient
              treatment of schizophrenia. The patient recruitment and
              assessment began in September 2000 and finished in early 2005. A
              total of 10 972 adult patients from ten European countries who
              were initiating or changing antipsychotic medication for the
              treatment of schizophrenia within the normal course of care have
              been enrolled. The patients have been followed at regular
              intervals over the 3-year timeframe of the study. Evaluation
              includes clinical severity, measured with the Clinical Global
              Impression (CGI) scale; health-related quality of life; social
              functioning; and medication tolerability. The 6- and 12-month
              results have been published so far and have demonstrated that the
              patients in whom treatment was initiated with olanzapine or
              clozapine or who were started on more than one antipsychotic of
              any class at baseline tended to have somewhat greater improvement
              than patients treated with other atypical or typical
              antipsychotics, both in terms of symptoms measured with the CGI
              and quality of life. Numbers of social contacts increased with
              the treatment, but other aspects of social functioning did not
              show any significant change. Atypical antipsychotics as a class
              were associated with a lower frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms
              (EPS) and anticholinergic use than typical antipsychotics. The
              frequency of EPS was lowest in the clozapine-, quetiapine- and
              olanzapine-treated patients, at around 10\%. The atypical
              antipsychotics also conferred a lower risk for tardive dyskinesia
              than the typical antipsychotics. Weight gain occurred in all
              treatment cohorts over the first 12 months of treatment and was
              statistically significantly greater in the patients who started
              treatment with olanzapine and clozapine. Prolactin- and
              sexually-related adverse events were frequent at baseline
              assessment: amenorrhoea was present in around one- third of
              women, impotence in around 40\% of men, and loss of libido in
              50\% of both male and female patients. Patients treated with
              olanzapine, clozapine and quetiapine were significantly less
              likely to have sexual/endocrine-related dysfunctions after 6
              months of treatment (the 12-month results of this parameter are
              yet to be published) than those in the other treatment cohorts
              (typical antipsychotics, risperidone and amisulpride).
              Concomitant medication use during the study has been high,
              ranging from 5\% to 29\% for anticholinergics, 8\% to 23\% for
              antidepressants, 22\% to 37\% for anxiolytics and 7\% to 19\% for
              mood stabilisers, depending on the type of antipsychotic
              prescribed. Fewer olanzapine-, quetiapine- and clozapine-treated
              patients used concomitant anticholinergics or
              anxiolytics/hypnotics. The current results from the SOHO study
              indicate that differences in effectiveness and tolerability do
              exist between the antipsychotics. Future results from the study
              will be published during the coming months and years, and will
              allow patterns of antipsychotic use in routine clinical practice
              (including how often and why changes are made) to be determined.
              This important information is likely to impact on the future use
              of antipsychotics and will assist clinicians in refining the use
              of these drugs and improving the outcome of patients to whom they
              are prescribed.",

              the 1950s, they were thought to work by inducing a state of
              neurological suppression, which reduced behavioral disturbance as
              well as psychotic symptoms. This view was reflected in the name
              ``neuroleptic.'' Within a few years, however, the idea that the
              drugs were a disease-specific treatment for schizophrenia or
              psychosis, and that they worked by modifying the underlying
              pathology of the condition, replaced this earlier view, and they
              became known as ``antipsychotics.'' This transformation of views
              about the drugs' mode of action occurred with little debate or
              empirical evaluation in the psychiatric literature and obscured
              earlier evidence about the nature of these drugs. Drug
              advertisements in the British Journal of Psychiatry reflect the
              same changes, although the nondisease-specific view persisted for
              longer. It is suggested that professional interests rather than
              scientific merit facilitated the rise of the disease-specific
              view of drug action. The increasing popularity of atypical
              antipsychotics makes it important to examine the origins of the

              glucose. The results were combined in a meta-analysis. RESULTS:
              We included 48 studies with 105 relevant arms. Olanzapine
              produced more weight gain than all other second-generation
              antipsychotics except for clozapine where no difference was
              found. Clozapine produced more weight gain than risperidone,
              risperidone more than amisulpride, and sertindole more than
              risperidone. Olanzapine produced more cholesterol increase than
              aripiprazole, risperidone and ziprasidone. (No differences with
              amisulpride, clozapine and quetiapine were found). Quetiapine
              produced more cholesterol increase than risperidone and
              ziprasidone. Olanzapine produced more increase in glucose than
              amisulpride, aripiprazole, quetiapine, risperidone and
              ziprasidone; no difference was found with clozapine. CONCLUSIONS:
              Some SGAs lead to substantially more metabolic side effects than
              other SGAs. When choosing an SGA for an individual patient these
              side effects with their potential cause of secondary diseases
              must be weighed against efficacy and characteristics of the
              individual patient.",

              Antipsychotic drugs are its treatment of choice, but there is
              controversy about which agent should be used. We aimed to compare
              and rank antipsychotics by quantifying information from
              randomised controlled trials. METHODS: We did a network
              meta-analysis of placebo-controlled and head-to-head randomised
              controlled trials and compared 32 antipsychotics. We searched
              Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, BIOSIS, Cochrane Central
              Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), WHO International
              Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov from
              database inception to Jan 8, 2019. Two authors independently
              selected studies and extracted data. We included randomised
              controlled trials in adults with acute symptoms of schizophrenia
              or related disorders. We excluded studies in patients with
              treatment resistance, first episode, predominant negative or
              depressive symptoms, concomitant medical illnesses, and
              relapse-prevention studies. Our primary outcome was change in
              overall symptoms measured with standardised rating scales. We
              also extracted data for eight efficacy and eight safety outcomes.
              Differences in the findings of the studies were explored in
              metaregressions and sensitivity analyses. Effect size measures
              were standardised mean differences, mean differences, or risk
              ratios with 95\% credible intervals (CrIs). Confidence in the
              evidence was assessed using CINeMA (Confidence in Network
              Meta-Analysis). The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO,
              number CRD42014014919. FINDINGS: We identified 54 417 citations
              and included 402 studies with data for 53 463 participants.
              Effect size estimates suggested all antipsychotics reduced
              overall symptoms more than placebo (although not statistically
              significant for six drugs), with standardised mean differences
              ranging from -0·89 (95\% CrI -1·08 to -0·71) for clozapine to
              -0·03 (-0·59 to 0·52) for levomepromazine (40 815 participants).
              Standardised mean differences compared with placebo for reduction
              of positive symptoms (31 179 participants) varied from -0·69
              (95\% CrI -0·86 to -0·52) for amisulpride to -0·17 (-0·31 to
              -0·04) for brexpiprazole, for negative symptoms (32 015
              participants) from -0·62 (-0·84 to -0·39; clozapine) to -0·10
              (-0·45 to 0·25; flupentixol), for depressive symptoms (19 683
              participants) from -0·90 (-1·36 to -0·44; sulpiride) to 0·04
              (-0·39 to 0·47; flupentixol). Risk ratios compared with placebo

              0·52 (0·12 to 0·95; clopenthixol) to 1·15 (0·36 to 1·47;
              pimozide), for sedation (30 770 participants) from 0·92 (0·17 to
              2·03; pimozide) to 10·20 (4·72 to 29·41; zuclopenthixol), for use
              of antiparkinson medication (24 911 participants) from 0·46 (0·19
              to 0·88; clozapine) to 6·14 (4·81 to 6·55; pimozide). Mean
              differences compared to placebo for weight gain (28 317
              participants) ranged from -0·16 kg (-0·73 to 0·40; ziprasidone)
              to 3·21 kg (2·10 to 4·31; zotepine), for prolactin elevation (21
              569 participants) from -77·05 ng/mL (-120·23 to -33·54;
              clozapine) to 48·51 ng/mL (43·52 to 53·51; paliperidone) and for
              QTc prolongation (15 467 participants) from -2·21 ms (-4·54 to
              0·15; lurasidone) to 23·90 ms (20·56 to 27·33; sertindole).
              Conclusions for the primary outcome did not substantially change
              after adjusting for possible effect moderators or in sensitivity
              analyses (eg, when excluding placebo-controlled studies). The
              confidence in evidence was often low or very low. INTERPRETATION:
              There are some efficacy differences between antipsychotics, but
              most of them are gradual rather than discrete. Differences in
              side-effects are more marked. These findings will aid clinicians
              in balancing risks versus benefits of those drugs available in
              their countries. They should consider the importance of each
              outcome, the patients' medical problems, and preferences.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: It remains unclear when standard systematic reviews
              and meta-analyses that rely on published aggregate data (AD) can
              provide robust clinical conclusions. We aimed to compare the
              results from a large cohort of systematic reviews and
              meta-analyses based on individual participant data (IPD) with
              meta-analyses of published AD, to establish when the latter are
              most likely to be reliable and when the IPD approach might be
              required. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used 18 cancer systematic
              reviews that included IPD meta-analyses: all of those completed
              and published by the Meta-analysis Group of the MRC Clinical
              Trials Unit from 1991 to 2010. We extracted or estimated hazard
              ratios (HRs) and standard errors (SEs) for survival from trial
              reports and compared these with IPD equivalents at both the trial
              and meta-analysis level. We also extracted or estimated the
              number of events. We used paired t tests to assess whether HRs
              and SEs from published AD differed on average from those from
              IPD. We assessed agreement, and whether this was associated with
              trial or meta-analysis characteristics, using the approach of
              Bland and Altman. The 18 systematic reviews comprised 238 unique
              trials or trial comparisons, including 37,082 participants. A HR
              and SE could be generated for 127 trials, representing 53\% of
              the trials and approximately 79\% of eligible participants. On
              average, trial HRs derived from published AD were slightly more
              in favour of the research interventions than those from IPD (HRAD
              to HRIPD ratio = 0.95, p = 0.007), but the limits of agreement
              show that for individual trials, the HRs could deviate
              substantially. These limits narrowed with an increasing number of
              participants (p < 0.001) or a greater number (p < 0.001) or
              proportion (p < 0.001) of events in the AD. On average,
              meta-analysis HRs from published AD slightly tended to favour the
              research interventions whether based on fixed-effect (HRAD to
              HRIPD ratio = 0.97, p = 0.088) or random-effects (HRAD to HRIPD
              ratio = 0.96, p = 0.044) models, but the limits of agreement show
              that for individual meta-analyses, agreement was much more
              variable. These limits tended to narrow with an increasing number
              (p = 0.077) or proportion of events (p = 0.11) in the AD.
              However, even when the information size of the AD was large,
              individual meta-analysis HRs could still differ from their IPD
              equivalents by a relative 10\% in favour of the research
              intervention to 5\% in favour of control. We utilised the results
              to construct a decision tree for assessing whether an AD
              meta-analysis includes sufficient information, and when estimates
              of effects are most likely to be reliable. A lack of power at the
              meta-analysis level may have prevented us identifying additional
              factors associated with the reliability of AD meta-analyses, and
              we cannot be sure that our results are generalisable to all
              outcomes and effect measures. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we found
              that HRs from published AD were most likely to agree with those
              from IPD when the information size was large. Based on these
              findings, we provide guidance for determining systematically when
              standard AD meta-analysis will likely generate robust clinical
              conclusions, and when the IPD approach will add considerable
              value.",

              methodology since the introduction of lithium and the beginning
              of the modern era of psychopharmacology in 1949. The nature and
              importance of these changes have not been fully addressed to
              date. As methodological flaws in trials can lead to
              false-negative or false-positive results, the objective of our
              study was to evaluate the impact of methodological changes in
              psychopharmacology clinical research over the past 60 years.
              METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a systematic review
              from 1949 to 2009 on MEDLINE and Web of Science electronic
              databases, and a hand search of high impact journals on studies
              of seven major drugs (chlorpromazine, clozapine, risperidone,
              lithium, fluoxetine and lamotrigine). All controlled studies
              published 100 months after the first trial were included.
              Ninety-one studies met our inclusion criteria. We analyzed the
              major changes in abstract reporting, study design, participants'
              assessment and enrollment, methodology and statistical analysis.
              Our results showed that the methodology of psychiatric clinical
              trials changed substantially, with quality gains in abstract
              reporting, results reporting, and statistical methodology. Recent
              trials use more informed consent, periods of washout,
              intention-to-treat approach and parametric tests. Placebo use
              remains high and unchanged over time. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
              Clinical trial quality of psychopharmacological studies has
              changed significantly in most of the aspects we analyzed. There
              was significant improvement in quality reporting and internal
              validity. These changes have increased study efficiency; however,
              there is room for improvement in some aspects such as rating
              scales, diagnostic criteria and better trial reporting.
              Therefore, despite the advancements observed, there are still
              several areas that can be improved in psychopharmacology clinical

              clinical trials is welcome. Much focus has been on
              under-reporting of trials and access to individual patient data
              to allow independent verification of findings. There are many
              other good reasons for data sharing from clinical trials. We
              describe some key issues in data sharing, including the
              challenges of open access to data. These include issues in
              consent and disclosure; risks in identification, including
              self-identification; risks in distorting data to prevent
              self-identification; and risks in analysis. These risks have led
              us to develop a controlled access policy, which safeguards the
              rights of patients entered in our trials, guards the intellectual
              property rights of the original researchers who designed the

              data sharing, including ensuring that data are discoverable and
              how to deal with old studies. We describe data sharing activities
              at the MRC Clinical Trials Unit. RESULTS: One hundred and three
              data sharing activities were logged from 2012 to 2014 from
              external and internal applicants. The motivations are varied, but
              none have been for replication of the primary results.
              CONCLUSIONS: For any request to share data, we note the important
              role of independent reviewers as well as reviewers who know the
              study well, and present some of the key questions that all
              reviewers should ask when deciding whether a request is
              reasonable. We consider the responsibilities of all parties. We
              highlight the potential for opportunity costs. Clinical trial
              data should be shared for reasonable requests but there are many
              practical issues that must be explicitly considered.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: One of the key elements of comparative treatment
              effectiveness research is head-to-head trials. We herein describe
              the control arms and the treatment received by patients in
              recently conducted or ongoing randomized controlled trials of
              biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for
              rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: We identified all protocols
              recorded in ClinicalTrials.gov to October 1, 2009. We extracted
              trial length and funding, prior treatment, disease activity in
              eligible patients, and the treatment received in both trial arms.
              RESULTS: Among the 91 trials identified (15 DMARD-naive trials,
              63 biologic-naive trials, and 13 biologic-second-line trials)
              involving 18, 554 patients in control arms (3059, 13 095, and
              2400 patients, respectively), only 5 compared biologic DMARDs
              head-to-head (2 of 7 noncommercially funded trials and 3 of 84
              commercially funded trials). Two-thirds (66\%) of these trials
              are ongoing. Networks of treatment comparisons reflect a
              predominant use of placebo as a comparator (81 of 102 comparisons
              among the 91 trials). In all 15 DMARD-naive trials, all control
              patients received a new treatment. In 54 of the 63 biologic-naive
              trials, 9224 of the 13, 095 control patients received their
              previously ineffective treatment, 3848 for more than 6 months,
              despite high levels of disease activity and contrary to
              guidelines. In biologic-second-line trials, 851 of the 2400
              control patients received treatment comparable to their
              previously ineffective one. CONCLUSIONS: Head-to-head trials of
              biologic DMARDs are still exceptions. Exposing patients in
              control arms who had a previous partial response or nonresponse

               poisoning of the brain from toxins produced in other parts of
               the body, notably the sex glands, the intestines and the mouth.
               Emil Kraepelin's commitment to the autointoxication theory is
               ignored in the literature on the history of psychiatry due to

              Treatment Recommendations, initially published in 1998 and first
              revised in 2003, are based primarily on empirical data. Over the
              last 5 years, research on psychopharmacologic and psychosocial
              treatments for schizophrenia has continued to evolve, warranting
              an update of the PORT recommendations. In consultation with
              expert advisors, 2 Evidence Review Groups (ERGs) identified 41
              treatment areas for review and conducted electronic literature
              searches to identify all clinical studies published since the
              last PORT literature review. The ERGs also reviewed studies
              preceding 2002 in areas not covered by previous PORT reviews,
              including smoking cessation, substance abuse, and weight loss.
              The ERGs reviewed over 600 studies and synthesized the research
              evidence, producing recommendations for those treatments for
              which the evidence was sufficiently strong to merit

              the treatment areas reviewed. The methods and outcomes of the
              update process are presented here and resulted in recommendations
              for 16 psychopharmacologic and 8 psychosocial treatments for
              schizophrenia. Another 13 psychopharmacologic and 4 psychosocial

              efficacy in animal models for cognitive impairment in multiple
              cognitive domains relevant for schizophrenia. Improvements were
              found with 5-HT6R antagonists in preclinical tests for episodic
              memory, social cognition, executive function, working memory and
              several other tests for both learning and memory. In contrast,
              there is little evidence for efficacy on attention. It will be
              interesting to further investigate 5-HT6R antagonists in
              neurodevelopmental animal models which are based on prenatal
              exposure to specific environmental insults, and are characterized
              by a high level of face, construct and predictive validity for
              cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia. It is also
              important to do more add-on preclinical studies of 5-HT6
              antagonists with antipsychotics. Possible mechanisms of action to
              improve cognition have been described. 5-HT6R antagonists
              decrease GABA release and GABAergic interneuron excitability,
              which subsequently disinhibits glutamate and/or acetylcholine
              release and results in enhancement of synaptic plasticity.
              Furthermore, cognition could be improved by 5-HT6R antagonists,
              because these compounds increase the number of NCAM
              PSA-immunoreactive neurons in the dendate gyrus, inhibit mTOR and
              Fyn-tyrosine kinase and interact with DARPP-32. Interestingly,

              Scale (PANSS) for typological and dimensional assessment. Based
              on two established psychiatric rating systems, the 30-item PANSS
              was conceived as an operationalized, drug-sensitive instrument

              Diseases, is initially presented. In portraying this development,
              the struggle surrounding the clinical relevance of concepts on
              the one hand and their reliability and validity on the other are
              reflected. Thus far, diagnostic reliability has primarily been
              improved by focusing on externally observable symptoms in
              connection with expression and behavior. The identification of
              disease-specific symptoms, however, is principally achieved
              through the differential description of subjective experience.
              How this experience is to be explored and assessed remains for
              the most part unclear. With reference to its founder Karl
              Jaspers, the phenomenological method is presented as the decisive
              instrument for the assessment of experience. It is shown that a

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Because of the debate about whether second-generation
              antipsychotic drugs are better than first-generation
              antipsychotic drugs, we did a meta-analysis of randomised
              controlled trials to compare the effects of these two types of
              drugs in patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: We compared nine
              second-generation antipsychotic drugs with first-generation drugs
              for overall efficacy (main outcome), positive, negative and
              depressive symptoms, relapse, quality of life, extrapyramidal
              side-effects, weight gain, and sedation. FINDINGS: We included
              150 double-blind, mostly short-term, studies, with 21 533
              participants. We excluded open studies because they
              systematically favoured second-generation drugs. Four of these
              drugs were better than first-generation antipsychotic drugs for
              overall efficacy, with small to medium effect sizes (amisulpride
              -0.31 [95\% CI -0.44 to -0.19, p<0.0001], clozapine -0.52 [-0.75
              to -0.29, p<0.0001], olanzapine -0.28 [-0.38 to -0.18, p<0.0001],
              and risperidone -0.13 [-0.22 to -0.05, p=0.002]). The other
              second-generation drugs were not more efficacious than the
              first-generation drugs, even for negative symptoms. Therefore
              efficacy on negative symptoms cannot be a core component of
              atypicality. Second-generation antipsychotic drugs induced fewer
              extrapyramidal side-effects than did haloperidol (even at low
              doses). Only a few have been shown to induce fewer extrapyramidal
              side-effects than low-potency first-generation antipsychotic
              drugs. With the exception of aripiprazole and ziprasidone,
              second-generation antipsychotic drugs induced more weight gain,
              in various degrees, than did haloperidol but not than low-potency
              first-generation drugs. The second-generation drugs also differed
              in their sedating properties. We did not note any consistent
              effects of moderator variables, such as industry sponsorship,
              comparator dose, or prophylactic antiparkinsonian medication.
              INTERPRETATION: Second-generation antipsychotic drugs differ in
              many properties and are not a homogeneous class. This
              meta-analysis provides data for individualised treatment based on
              efficacy, side-effects, and cost.",

              Efficacy studies have already shown the unique effectiveness of
              clozapine, and suggested improved outcomes for olanzapine
              compared with some atypical antipsychotics and a reduced tendency
              to produce acute and chronic movement disorders for atypical
              compared with typical drugs. Recent effectiveness studies largely
              confirm these prior observations. The CATIE (Clinical
              Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness), CUtLASS
              (Cost Utility of the Latest Antipsychotic Drugs in Schizophrenia
              Study) and SOHO (Schizophrenia Outpatient Health Outcomes)
              programmes confirmed the superiority of clozapine over other
              antipsychotics; CATIE and SOHO also confirmed olanzapine as
              probably the second most effective antipsychotic. Effectiveness
              studies have confirmed the high incidence of adverse metabolic
              effects with clozapine, olanzapine and (with less certainty)
              quetiapine but the ZODIAC (Ziprasidone Observational Study of

              action of risk genes. We studied each of the drugs from the
              interactome using the BaseSpace Correlation Engine, and
              shortlisted those that had a negative correlation with
              differential gene expression of schizophrenia. This analysis
              resulted in 12 drugs whose differential gene expression (drug

              schizophrenia relapse prevention is controversial, and use of
              multiple agents is generally believed to impair physical
              well-being. Objective: To study the association of specific
              antipsychotic combinations with psychiatric rehospitalization.
              Design, Setting, and Participants: In this nationwide cohort
              study, the risk of psychiatric rehospitalization was used as a
              marker for relapse among 62 250 patients with schizophrenia
              during the use of 29 different antipsychotic monotherapy and
              polypharmacy types between January 1, 1996, and December 31,
              2015, in a comprehensive, nationwide cohort in Finland. We
              conducted analysis of the data from April 24 to June 15, 2018.
              Rehospitalization risks were investigated by using
              within-individual analyses to minimize selection bias. Main
              Outcomes and Measures: Hazard ratio (HR) for psychiatric
              rehospitalization during use of polypharmacy vs during
              monotherapy within the same individual. Results: In the total
              cohort, including 62 250 patients, 31 257 individuals (50.2\%)
              were men, and the median age was 45.6 (interquartile range,
              34.6-57.9) years. The clozapine plus aripiprazole combination was
              associated with the lowest risk of psychiatric rehospitalization
              in the total cohort, being superior to clozapine, the monotherapy
              associated with the best outcomes, with a difference of 14\% (HR,
              0.86; 95\% CI, 0.79-0.94) in the analysis including all
              polypharmacy periods, and 18\% in the conservatively defined
              polypharmacy analysis excluding periods shorter than 90 days (HR,
              0.82; 95\% CI, 0.75-0.89; P < .001). Among patients with their
              first episode of schizophrenia, these differences between
              clozapine plus aripiprazole vs clozapine monotherapy were greater
              (difference, 22\%; HR, 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.63-0.96 in the analysis
              including all polypharmacy periods, and difference, 23\%; HR,
              0.77; 95\% CI, 0.63-0.95 in the conservatively defined
              polypharmacy analysis). At the aggregate level, any antipsychotic
              polypharmacy was associated with a 7\% to 13\% lower risk of
              psychiatric rehospitalization compared with any monotherapy
              (ranging from HR, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.85-0.88, to HR, 0.93; 95\% CI,
              0.91-0.95; P < .001). Clozapine was the only monotherapy among
              the 10 best treatments. Results on all-cause and somatic
              hospitalization, mortality, and other sensitivity analyses were
              in line with the primary outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance:
              Combining aripiprazole with clozapine was associated with the
              lowest risk of rehospitalization, indicating that certain types
              of polypharmacy may be feasible in the treatment of
              schizophrenia. Because add-on treatments are started when
              monotherapy is no longer sufficient to control for worsening of
              symptoms, it is likely that the effect sizes for polypharmacy are
              underestimates. Although the results do not indicate that all
              types of polypharmacy are beneficial, the current treatment
              guidelines should modify their categorical recommendations
              discouraging all antipsychotic polypharmacy in the maintenance

              lifespan than the general population. This excess mortality is
              mainly due to physical illness. Next to mental illness-related
              factors, unhealthy lifestyle, and disparities in health care
              access and utilization, psychotropic medications can contribute
              to the risk of physical morbidity and mortality. We
              systematically reviewed the effects of antipsychotics,
              antidepressants and mood stabilizers on physical health outcomes
              in people with schizophrenia, depression and bipolar disorder.
              Updating and expanding our prior systematic review published in
              this journal, we searched MEDLINE (November 2009 - November
              2014), combining the MeSH terms of major physical disease
              categories (and/or relevant diseases within these categories)
              with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and bipolar
              disorder, and the three major psychotropic classes which received
              regulatory approval for these disorders, i.e., antipsychotics,
              antidepressants and mood stabilizers. We gave precedence to
              results from (systematic) reviews and meta-analyses wherever
              possible. Antipsychotics, and to a more restricted degree
              antidepressants and mood stabilizers, are associated with an
              increased risk for several physical diseases, including obesity,
              dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorders, hyponatremia;
              cardiovascular, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal,
              haematological, musculoskeletal and renal diseases, as well as
              movement and seizure disorders. Higher dosages, polypharmacy, and
              treatment of vulnerable (e.g., old or young) individuals are
              associated with greater absolute (elderly) and relative (youth)
              risk for most of these physical diseases. To what degree
              medication-specific and patient-specific risk factors interact,
              and how adverse outcomes can be minimized, allowing patients to
              derive maximum benefits from these medications, requires adequate
              clinical attention and further research.",

              negative symptoms and cognitive impairments for which no
              effective treatments are known. Agents that act at the glycine
              site of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) glutamatergic
              receptor have been suggested as promising treatments for moderate
              to severe negative symptoms and cognitive impairments. METHOD:
              The Cognitive and Negative Symptoms in Schizophrenia Trial
              (CONSIST) was a 16-week double-blind, double-dummy, parallel
              group, randomized clinical trial of adjunctive glycine,
              D-cycloserine, or placebo conducted at four sites in the United
              States and one site in Israel. The participants were 157
              inpatients and outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for
              schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and retrospective and
              prospective criteria for moderate to severe negative symptoms
              without marked positive, depressive, or extrapyramidal symptoms.
              The primary outcome measures were the average ``rate of change''
              of Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) total
              scores and change in the average cognitive domain z scores.
              RESULTS: There were no significant differences in change in the
              SANS total score between glycine and placebo subjects or
              D-cycloserine and placebo subjects. A prespecified test for the
              site-by-treatment-by-time interaction was significant in post hoc
              tests. One site had greater reduction in the SANS total score for
              patients receiving D-cycloserine relative to patients receiving
              placebo. A second site had greater reduction in the SANS total
              score for placebo patients compared with glycine patients. There
              were no significant differences between glycine and placebo or
              D-cycloserine and placebo subjects on the average cognition z
              score. CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that neither
              glycine nor D-cycloserine is a generally effective therapeutic
              option for treating negative symptoms or cognitive impairments.",

              years have focused on the specificity model in which it is
              assumed that psychiatric disorders are specific entities which
              should respond to drugs with specific mechanisms of action.
              However, the validity of this model has been challenged by the
              approval of multiple drugs for the same disorder, as well as the
              approval of single agents for a variety of disorders which have
              little in common. As an example of this unacknowledged paradigm
              shift, I will examine the foundation for using antipsychotics in
              the treatment of depression. METHODS: An extensive literature
              search of studies investigating various mechanisms of actions of
              antipsychotics and antidepressants with the goal of identifying
              neurochemical processes common to both. RESULTS: The
              neurochemical differences in these classes of drugs appear to be
              profound, although several processes are common in both,
              including some degree of neuroprotection and changes in the
              epigenome. Whether these common features have any effect on
              clinical outcome remains in doubt. CONCLUSIONS: While
              psychopharmacology and psychiatry remain largely committed to the
              specificity model, it appears that clinicians are prescribing on
              a dimensional model wherein symptoms are being treated with a
              variety of drugs, regardless of the diagnosis.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Although atypical antipsychotics are becoming the
              treatment of choice for schizophrenia, what makes an
              antipsychotic ``atypical'' is not clear. This article provides a
              new hypothesis about the mechanism of action of atypical
              antipsychotics. METHOD: Published data regarding the molecular,
              animal model, neuroimaging, and clinical aspects of typical and
              atypical antipsychotics were reviewed to develop this hypothesis.
              Particular attention was paid to data regarding the role of the
              serotonin 5-HT(2) and dopamine D(4) receptors in atypicality.
              RESULTS: Neuroimaging data show that optimal dopamine D(2)
              occupancy is sufficient to produce the atypical antipsychotic
              effect. Freedom from motor side effects results from low D(2)
              occupancy, not from high 5-HT(2) occupancy. If D(2) occupancy is
              excessive, atypicality is lost even in the presence of high
              5-HT(2) occupancy. Animal data show that a rapid dissociation
              from the D(2) receptor at a molecular level produces the atypical
              antipsychotic effect. In vitro data show that the single most
              powerful predictor of atypicality for the current generation of
              atypical antipsychotics is fast dissociation from the D(2)
              receptor, not its high affinity at 5-HT(2), D(4), or another
              receptor. CONCLUSIONS: The authors propose that fast dissociation
              from the D(2) receptor makes an antipsychotic more accommodating
              of physiological dopamine transmission, permitting an
              antipsychotic effect without motor side effects, prolactin
              elevation, or secondary negative symptoms. In contrast to the
              multireceptor hypotheses, the authors predict that the atypical
              antipsychotic effect can be produced by appropriate modulation of
              the D(2) receptor alone; the blockade of other receptors is
              neither necessary nor sufficient.",

              enormously important for the advancement of the field. In
              contrast, the critical relevance of trial conduct and
              implementation have only more recently been the focus of
              discussion and research. Although randomized controlled trials
              are generally considered the gold standard for the assessment of
              pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions in medicine,
              trials are vulnerable to complications and influences that can
              seriously compromise their success. Like interventions, trial
              design and conduct are also contextual. They need to be
              individualized and adapted to a number of relevant variables,
              such as setting, population, illness phase, interventions,
              patient and rater expectations and biases, and the overall aims
              of the investigation. While this means that there is no unified
              approach possible, certain general principles and guidelines
              require careful consideration. Knowledge of basic solutions and
              alternatives, and the recognition of the complex challenges that
              need to be addressed proactively can help to minimize unwanted
              outcomes, including trial failure and uninformative or falsely
              negative outcomes. Moreover, novel design alternatives need to be
              explored that target sample enrichment according to the study
              question and enhancement of precision in the measurement of
              relevant outcomes. We propose two novel design strategies that
              take advantage of the recently validated early antipsychotic
              response paradigm (that has also been observed with
              antidepressants and mood stabilizers). In the ``early responder
              randomized discontinuation design'' all patients are assigned to
              the active drug, and only those who had at least a minimal
              response at 2 weeks are enrolled in a double-blind,
              placebo-controlled discontinuation trial, enriching the placebo
              controlled trial portion with true drug responders. In the mirror
              image ``early nonresponder randomized dose increase or
              augmentation design,'' early nonresponders at 2 weeks are
              assigned to staying on the medication or going either to a higher
              dose or an augmentation agent. It is hoped that through increased
              attention to the issues raised in this article and further
              refinement of trial methodology and conduct, the field will make

  abstract = "Adherence to antipsychotic medication is critical for the
              treatment of patients with schizophrenia. Impaired insight into
              illness is one of the principal drivers of medication
              nonadherence, which contributes to negative clinical outcomes.
              The aims of this study were to examine the relationships between
              impaired insight and (1) rates of antipsychotic medication
              nonadherence, and (2) time to medication nonadherence using data
              from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention
              Effectiveness (CATIE) study. Insight was assessed using the
              Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) item G12 (lack of
              judgment and insight). Patients were divided into 3 groups based
              on their degree of insight impairment, i.e. no impairment (PANSS
              G12 = 1), minimal impairment (PANSS G12 = 2-3), and
              moderate-to-severe insight impairment (PANSS G12 $\geq$ 4).
              Medication nonadherence was defined as taking less than 80\% of
              monthly pill counts. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression
              analyses were performed to examine differences in time to
              medication nonadherence between insight groups. There were
              significant differences between insight groups in the percentage
              of nonadherent patients at 6 months ($\chi$2(2) = 8.80, p =
              0.012) and 18 months ($\chi$2(2) = 10.04, p = 0.007) after study
              initiation. Moderate-to-severe insight impairment was associated
              with earlier nonadherence compared to minimal ($\chi$2 = 4.70, p
              = 0.030) or no impairment ($\chi$2 = 11.92, p = 0.001). The
              association remained significant after adjustment for illness
              severity, substance use, attitudes toward medication, cognition,
              level of hostility, and depression. The results of this study
              indicate a strong link between impaired insight and antipsychotic
              medication nonadherence. Interventions to enhance insight early
              during treatment may help improve medication adherence, and in
              turn, long-term clinical and functional outcomes in patients with
              schizophrenia. This article is part of the issue entitled

  abstract = "Development of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), particularly
              tardive dyskinesia (TD), has long been a troubling side effect
              for patients taking antipsychotics. Atypical antipsychotics have
              been hailed as an improvement over conventional antipsychotics,
              offering similar efficacy with more favorable EPS profiles. In
              the recent Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention
              Effectiveness (CATIE) study, which compared the conventional
              antipsychotic perphenazine with atypical antipsychotics
              olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone in patients
              with schizophrenia, no significant differences in time to
              treatment discontinuation due to intolerability were observed
              between treatment groups. However, perphenazine was associated
              with a higher rate of patients experiencing EPS as well as a
              significantly higher rate of discontinuation due to EPS, despite
              the fact that patients with TD at baseline were excluded from the
              perphenazine group. Unfortunately, due to short treatment
              duration, the CATIE study did not have the assay sensitivity to
              detect differences in TD risk among any of the drugs. Thus, the
              atypical antipsychotics remain the first line of treatment for
              most patients, with specific drug selection based on benefit-risk
              profiles that best fit the individual patient's needs. Frequent
              monitoring, while noting a patient's subjective experience,
              remains the best strategy for choosing therapy to maximize
              symptom relief and minimize the impact of EPS and other side
              effects over the long- term. This article explores the reported
              results of the CATIE trial regarding EPS and emphasizes the
              differentiation of the atypicals from perphenazine on EPS and how
              these results should be incorporated into daily practice for the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The question of which antipsychotic drug should be
              preferred for the treatment of schizophrenia is controversial,
              and conventional pairwise meta-analyses cannot provide a
              hierarchy based on the randomised evidence. We aimed to integrate
              the available evidence to create hierarchies of the comparative
              efficacy, risk of all-cause discontinuation, and major
              side-effects of antipsychotic drugs. METHODS: We did a
              Bayesian-framework, multiple-treatments meta-analysis (which uses
              both direct and indirect comparisons) of randomised controlled
              trials to compare 15 antipsychotic drugs and placebo in the acute
              treatment of schizophrenia. We searched the Cochrane
              Schizophrenia Group's specialised register, Medline, Embase, the
              Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and
              ClinicalTrials.gov for reports published up to Sept 1, 2012.
              Search results were supplemented by reports from the US Food and
              Drug Administration website and by data requested from
              pharmaceutical companies. Blinded, randomised controlled trials
              of patients with schizophrenia or related disorders were
              eligible. We excluded trials done in patients with predominant
              negative symptoms, concomitant medical illness, or treatment
              resistance, and those done in stable patients. Data for seven
              outcomes were independently extracted by two reviewers. The
              primary outcome was efficacy, as measured by mean overall change
              in symptoms. We also examined all-cause discontinuation, weight
              gain, extrapyramidal side-effects, prolactin increase, QTc
              prolongation, and sedation. FINDINGS: We identified 212 suitable
              trials, with data for 43 049 participants. All drugs were
              significantly more effective than placebo. The standardised mean
              differences with 95\% credible intervals were: clozapine 0·88,
              0·73-1·03; amisulpride 0·66, 0·53-0·78; olanzapine 0·59,

              lurasidone 0·33, 0·21-0·45; and iloperidone 0·33, 0·22-0·43. Odds
              ratios compared with placebo for all-cause discontinuation ranged
              from 0·43 for the best drug (amisulpride) to 0·80 for the worst
              drug (haloperidol); for extrapyramidal side-effects 0·30
              (clozapine) to 4·76 (haloperidol); and for sedation 1·42
              (amisulpride) to 8·82 (clozapine). Standardised mean differences
              compared with placebo for weight gain varied from -0·09 for the
              best drug (haloperidol) to -0·74 for the worst drug (olanzapine),
              for prolactin increase 0·22 (aripiprazole) to -1·30
              (paliperidone), and for QTc prolongation 0·10 (lurasidone) to
              -0·90 (sertindole). Efficacy outcomes did not change
              substantially after removal of placebo or haloperidol groups, or
              when dose, percentage of withdrawals, extent of blinding,
              pharmaceutical industry sponsorship, study duration, chronicity,
              and year of publication were accounted for in meta-regressions
              and sensitivity analyses. INTERPRETATION: Antipsychotics differed
              substantially in side-effects, and small but robust differences
              were seen in efficacy. Our findings challenge the straightforward
              classification of antipsychotics into first-generation and
              second-generation groupings. Rather, hierarchies in the different
              domains should help clinicians to adapt the choice of
              antipsychotic drug to the needs of individual patients. These
              findings should be considered by mental health policy makers and
              in the revision of clinical practice guidelines. FUNDING: None.",

              patients with predominant negative symptoms. METHODS: In this
              randomised, double-blind, phase 3b trial, we enrolled adults aged
              18-65 years with long-term (>2 year), stable schizophrenia and
              predominant negative symptoms (>6 months) at 66 study centres
              (mainly hospitals and university clinics, with a small number of
              private practices) in 11 European countries. Patients were
              randomly assigned (1:1) by an interactive web response system to
              26 weeks of monotherapy with fixed-dose oral cariprazine (3 mg,

              received at least one dose of study drug. This study is
              registered with EudraCT, number 2012-005485-36. FINDINGS: Between
              May 27, 2013, and Nov 17, 2014, 533 patients were screened and
              461 (86\%) patients were randomised to treatment (230 for
              cariprazine and 231 for risperidone); 460 were included in the
              safety population (one patient discontinued before study drug
              intake). 227 (99\%) of 230 patients in the cariprazine group and
              229 (99\%) of 230 patients in the risperidone group were included
              in the modified intention-to-treat population (178 [77\%] in each
              group completed 26 weeks of treatment). Mean daily doses were 4·2
              mg (SD 0·6) for cariprazine and 3·8 mg (0·4) for risperidone.
              Treatment-emergent adverse events (eg, insomnia, akathisia,
              worsening of schizophrenia, headache, anxiety) were reported in
              123 (54\%) patients treated with cariprazine and 131 (57\%)
              patients treated with risperidone. Use of cariprazine led to a
              greater least squares mean change in PANSS-FSNS from baseline to
              week 26 than did risperidone (-8·90 points for cariprazine vs

              Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses",
  author   = "Ioannidis, John P A",
  abstract = "POLICY POINTS: Currently, there is massive production of
              unnecessary, misleading, and conflicted systematic reviews and
              meta-analyses. Instead of promoting evidence-based medicine and
              health care, these instruments often serve mostly as easily
              produced publishable units or marketing tools. Suboptimal
              systematic reviews and meta-analyses can be harmful given the
              major prestige and influence these types of studies have
              acquired. The publication of systematic reviews and meta-analyses
              should be realigned to remove biases and vested interests and to
              integrate them better with the primary production of evidence.
              CONTEXT: Currently, most systematic reviews and meta-analyses are
              done retrospectively with fragmented published information. This
              article aims to explore the growth of published systematic
              reviews and meta-analyses and to estimate how often they are
              redundant, misleading, or serving conflicted interests. METHODS:
              Data included information from PubMed surveys and from empirical
              evaluations of meta-analyses. FINDINGS: Publication of systematic
              reviews and meta-analyses has increased rapidly. In the period
              January 1, 1986, to December 4, 2015, PubMed tags 266,782 items
              as ``systematic reviews'' and 58,611 as ``meta-analyses.'' Annual
              publications between 1991 and 2014 increased 2,728\% for
              systematic reviews and 2,635\% for meta-analyses versus only
              153\% for all PubMed-indexed items. Currently, probably more
              systematic reviews of trials than new randomized trials are
              published annually. Most topics addressed by meta-analyses of
              randomized trials have overlapping, redundant meta-analyses;
              same-topic meta-analyses may exceed 20 sometimes. Some fields
              produce massive numbers of meta-analyses; for example, 185
              meta-analyses of antidepressants for depression were published
              between 2007 and 2014. These meta-analyses are often produced
              either by industry employees or by authors with industry ties and
              results are aligned with sponsor interests. China has rapidly
              become the most prolific producer of English-language,
              PubMed-indexed meta-analyses. The most massive presence of
              Chinese meta-analyses is on genetic associations (63\% of global
              production in 2014), where almost all results are misleading
              since they combine fragmented information from mostly abandoned
              era of candidate genes. Furthermore, many contracting companies
              working on evidence synthesis receive industry contracts to
              produce meta-analyses, many of which probably remain unpublished.
              Many other meta-analyses have serious flaws. Of the remaining,
              most have weak or insufficient evidence to inform decision
              making. Few systematic reviews and meta-analyses are both

              Effectiveness) Schizophrenia Trial was designed to examine
              fundamental issues about second-generation antipsychotic (SGA)
              medications (olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and
              ziprasidone) - their relative effectiveness and their
              effectiveness compared to a first-generation antipsychotic (FGA),
              perphenazine. This article reviews these and other findings from
              this important trial and offers a perspective regarding their
              meaning for practice and their significance for the advancement
              of research in psychiatry. The primary outcome measure, time to
              discontinuation, served as an index of effectiveness and was
              remarkably short; only 26\% of subjects completed the 18-month
              trial on the medicine to which they were initially randomized.
              Subjects receiving olanzapine experienced a slightly longer time
              to discontinuation. Based on this single criterion, olanzapine
              showed greater effectiveness than the other agents despite its
              association with significant metabolic disturbance, especially
              weight gain. Perphenazine unexpectedly showed comparable levels
              of effectiveness and produced no more extrapyramidal side effects
              than the other agents. Despite modest prolactin elevation,
              risperidone was the best-tolerated medication. Ziprasidone was
              associated with weight loss and with positive impact on lipids
              and blood glucose. In Phase 2, clozapine demonstrated better
              effectiveness compared to other SGAs for subjects who
              discontinued their Phase 1 medication because of efficacy.
              Olanzapine and risperidone showed greater effectiveness in the
              tolerability pathway. CATIE secondary outcomes are currently
              being examined. Improvements in cognition were modest among all
              the agents in Phase 1, and perphenazine was no less effective in
              improving cognitive performance than the SGAs. Cost-effectiveness
              analysis revealed a significant advantage for perphenazine, due
              to the impact of the high-priced, brand-name SGAs on overall

              the 1960s, it describes the discovery of the sedative properties

               scientific disciplines, including psychology, medicine, and
               experimental economics, have created a ?crisis of confidence?
               among scientists. Psychological science has been at the
               forefront of tackling these issues, with discussions about
               replication failures and scientific self-criticisms of
               questionable research practices (QRPs) increasingly taking place
               in public forums. How this replicability crisis impacts the
               public?s trust is a question yet to be answered by research.
               Whereas some researchers believe that the public?s trust will be
               positively impacted or maintained, others believe trust will be
               diminished. Because it is our field of expertise, we focus on
               trust in psychological science. We performed a study testing how
               public trust in past and future psychological research would be
               impacted by being informed about (i) replication failures
               (replications group), (ii) replication failures and criticisms
               of QRPs (QRPs group), and (iii) replication failures, criticisms
               of QRPs, and proposed reforms (reforms group). Results from a
               mostly European sample (N = 1129) showed that, compared to a
               control group, people in the replications, QRPs, and reforms
               groups self-reported less trust in past research. Regarding
               trust in future research, the replications and QRPs groups did
               not significantly differ from the control group. Surprisingly,
               the reforms group had less trust in future research than the
               control group. Nevertheless, people in the replications, QRPs,
               and reforms groups did not significantly differ from the control
               group in how much they believed future research in psychological

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Relapse prevention with antipsychotic drugs compared
              with placebo in patients with schizophrenia has not been
              sufficiently addressed by previous systematic reviews. We aimed
              to assess the association between such drugs and various outcomes
              in patients with schizophrenia to resolve controversial issues.
              METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's
              specialised register for reports published before Nov 11, 2008;
              and PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov for those before June
              8, 2011. We also contacted pharmaceutical companies and searched
              the reference lists of included studies and previous reviews.
              Randomised trials of patients with schizophrenia continued on or
              withdrawn from any antipsychotic drug regimen after stabilisation
              were eligible. Our primary outcome was relapse between 7 and 12
              months. We also examined safety and various functional outcomes.
              We used the random effects model and verified results for the
              primary outcome with a fixed effects model. Heterogeneity was
              investigated with subgroup and meta-regression analyses.
              FINDINGS: We identified 116 suitable reports from 65 trials, with
              data for 6493 patients. Antipsychotic drugs significantly reduced
              relapse rates at 1 year (drugs 27\%vs placebo 64\%; risk ratio
              [RR] 0·40, 95\% CI 0·33-0·49; number needed to treat to benefit
              [NNTB] 3, 95\% CI 2-3). Fewer patients given antipsychotic drugs
              than placebo were readmitted (10\%vs 26\%; RR 0·38, 95\% CI
              0·27-0·55; NNTB 5, 4-9), but less than a third of relapsed
              patients had to be admitted. Limited evidence suggested better
              quality of life (standardised mean difference -0·62, 95\% CI
              -1·15 to -0·09) and fewer aggressive acts (2\%vs 12\%; RR 0·27,
              95\% CI 0·15-0·52; NNTB 11, 6-100) with antipsychotic drugs than
              with placebo. Employment data were scarce and too few deaths were
              reported to allow significant differences to be identified. More
              patients given antipsychotic drugs than placebo gained weight
              (10\%vs 6\%; RR 2·07, 95\% CI 2·31-3·25), had movement disorders
              (16\%vs 9\%; 1·55, 1·25-1·93), and experienced sedation (13\%vs
              9\%; 1·50, 1·22-1·84). Substantial heterogeneity in size of
              effect was recorded. In subgroup analyses, number of episodes,
              whether patients were in remission, abrupt or gradual withdrawal
              of treatment, length of stability before trial entry,
              first-generation or second-generation drugs, and allocation
              concealment method did not significantly affect relapse risk.
              Depot preparations reduced relapse (RR 0·31, 95\% CI 0·21-0·41)
              more than did oral drugs (0·46, 0·37-0·57; p=0·03); depot
              haloperidol (RR 0·14, 95\% CI 0·04-0·55) and fluphenazine (0·23,
              0·14-0·39) had the greatest effects. The effects of antipsychotic
              drugs were greater in two unblinded trials (0·26, 0·17-0·39) than
              in most blinded studies (0·42, 0·35-0·51; p= 0·03). In a
              meta-regression, the difference between drug and placebo
              decreased with study length. INTERPRETATION: Maintenance
              treatment with antipsychotic drugs benefits patients with
              schizophrenia. The advantages of these drugs must be weighed
              against their side-effects. Future studies should focus on
              outcomes of social participation and clarify the long-term
              morbidity and mortality of these drugs. FUNDING: German Ministry

              total symptom improvement (g = 0.47, p < 0.001) and reduced
              variability in symptomatic improvement for total (CVR = 0.86, p <
              0.001), positive (CVR = 0.89, p < 0.001), and negative symptoms
              (CVR = 0.86, p = 0.001). Lower variability in
              antipsychotic-response relative to placebo was associated with
              studies published earlier (z = 3.98, p < 0.001), younger patients
              (z = 3.07, p = 0.002), higher dose treatments (z = -2.62, p =
              0.009), and greater mean-difference in symptom-change (z = -5.70,
              p < 0.001). In the individual patient dataset (N = 522 patients),
              antipsychotic treated patients did not show significantly
              increased variability for any individual symptom, and there was
              no evidence of a bimodal distribution of response. Compared to
              placebo, antipsychotic treatment shows greater improvement and
              lower variability of change in total, positive and negative
              symptoms. This is contrary to the hypothesis that there is a
              subtype of antipsychotic non-responsive schizophrenia. Instead
              our findings, provide evidence for a relatively homogeneous
              effect of antipsychotic treatment in improving symptoms of
              schizophrenia.",

  abstract = "This review examines the history of discoveries that contributed
              to development of the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. The
              origin of the hypothesis is traced to the recognition that
              neuroleptic drugs interfere with brain dopamine function. This
              insight was derived from two distinct lines of research. The
              first line originated from the discovery in 1956 that reserpine
              depletes brain serotonin. This finding resulted in a sequence of
              studies that led to the discovery that brain dopamine is involved
              in neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal motor disturbances. The
              second line of research was aimed at determining the mechanism of
              action of psychomotor stimulants. This research produced evidence
              that stimulants directly or indirectly activate brain dopamine
              receptors. Because nonreserpine neuroleptics such as
              chlorpromazine block stimulant-induced movement, these findings
              suggested that neuroleptics were dopamine antagonists. Most
              previous accounts of the development of the dopamine hypothesis
              of schizophrenia emphasize the first line of research and ignore
              the second.",

  abstract = "Despite treatment advances over the past decades, schizophrenia
              remains one of the most severe psychiatric disorders that is
              associated with a chronic relapsing course and marked functional
              impairment in a substantial proportion of patients. In this
              article, a historical overview of the pharmacologic advances in
              the treatment of schizophrenia over the past 50 years is
              presented. This is followed by a review of the current
              developments in optimizing the treatment and outcomes in patients
              with schizophrenia. Methodological challenges, potential
              solutions, and areas of particular need for further research are
              highlighted. Although treatment goals of response, remission, and
              recovery have been defined more uniformly, a good
              ``effectiveness'' measure mapping onto functional outcomes is
              still lacking. Moreover, the field must advance in transferring
              measurement-based approaches from research to clinical practice.
              There is an ongoing debate regarding whether and which first- or
              second-generation antipsychotics should be used. However,
              especially when considering individual adverse effect profiles,
              the differentiation into first- and second-generation
              antipsychotics as unified classes cannot be upheld, and a more
              differentiated view and treatment selection are required. The
              desired, individualized treatment approach needs to consider
              current symptoms, comorbid conditions, past therapeutic response,
              and adverse effects, as well as patient choice and expectations.
              Acute and long-term goals and effects of medication treatment
              should be balanced. To date, clozapine is the only evidence-based
              treatment for refractory patients, and the role of antipsychotic
              polypharmacy and other augmentation strategies remains unclear,
              at best. To discover novel treatments with enhanced/broader
              efficacy and improved tolerability, and to enable personalized
              treatment, the mechanisms underlying illness development and
              progression, symptomatic improvement, and side effect development
              need to be elucidated.",
