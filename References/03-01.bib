              METHODS: 100 participants who had suffered a recent relapse in
              psychosis were recruited at baseline for the Prevention of
              Relapse in Psychosis (PRP) trial. In a cross-sectional analysis,
              we examined the role of depression, self-esteem and negative
              evaluative beliefs in relation to specific positive symptoms
              (persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations and grandiose
              delusions) and symptom dimensions (e.g. distress, negative
              content, pre-occupation and conviction). RESULTS: Analysis
              indicated that individuals with more depression and lower
              self-esteem had auditory hallucinations of greater severity and
              more intensely negative content, and were more distressed by
              them. In addition, individuals with more depression, lower
              self-esteem and more negative evaluations about themselves and
              others had persecutory delusions of greater severity and were
              more pre-occupied and distressed by them. The severity of
              grandiose delusions was related inversely to depression scores
              and negative evaluations about self, and directly to higher
              self-esteem. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for the
              role of emotion in schizophrenia spectrum-disorders. Mood,
              self-esteem and negative evaluative beliefs should be considered

  abstract = "During the 19th century and early 20th century, American
              psychiatry shared many intellectual traditions and values with
              Great Britain and Europe. These include principles derived from
              the Enlightenment concerning the dignity of the individual and
              the value of careful observation. During the 20th century,
              however, American psychiatry began to diverge, initially due to a
              much stronger emphasis on psychoanalytic principles, particularly
              in comparison with Great Britain. By the 1960s and 1970s, studies
              such as the US-UK study and the International Pilot Study of
              Schizophrenia demonstrated that the psychodynamic emphasis had
              gone too far, leading to diagnostic imprecision and inadequate
              evaluation of traditional evaluations of signs and symptoms of
              psychopathology. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
              Disorders, Third Edition (DSM-III) was developed in this context,
              under the leadership of representatives from institutions that
              had retained the more traditional British-European approaches
              (eg, Washington University, Iowa). The goal of DSM-III was to
              create a comprehensive system for diagnosing and evaluating
              psychiatric patients that would be more reliable, more valid, and
              more consistent with international approaches. This goal was
              realized in many respects, but unfortunately it also had many
              unintended consequences. Although the original creators realized
              that DSM represented a ``best effort'' rather than a definitive
              ``ground truth,'' DSM began to be given total authority in
              training programs and health care delivery systems. Since the
              publication of DSM-III in 1980, there has been a steady decline
              in the teaching of careful clinical evaluation that is targeted
              to the individual person's problems and social context and that
              is enriched by a good general knowledge of psychopathology.
              Students are taught to memorize DSM rather than to learn
              complexities from the great psychopathologists of the past. By
              2005, the decline has become so severe that it could be referred
              to as ``the death of phenomenology in the United States.''",

              status of training on psychopathology in Europe and to identify
              the unmet needs of training on psychopathology. METHODS: An
              online survey was carried out during the period July-December
              2013. Forty-one representatives of early career psychiatrists of
              their national associations were invited to participate. Each
              respondent was asked to provide the collective feedback of the
              association rather than that of any of its individual officer or
              member. RESULTS: Thirty-two associations returned the
              questionnaire out of the 41 contacted (response rate, 78\%). All
              respondents recognized psychopathology as a core component of
              training in psychiatry. According to respondents, the primary
              aims of psychopathology are (a) to assess psychiatric symptoms
              (47\%), (b) to understand patients' abnormal experiences (33\%),
              and (c) to make nosographical diagnosis (20\%). A formal training
              course in psychopathology is available in 29 out of the 32
              surveyed countries. In most countries, (a) there is not a defined
              number of hours dedicated to psychopathology, (b) teaching is
              mainly theoretical, and (c) a structured training on psychometric
              tools is missing. At the end of the training, about half of
              trainees is not satisfied with received training in
              psychopathology. CONCLUSIONS: According to European early career
              psychiatrists, there is the need to rethink training in
              psychopathology, which should be at the heart of training in
              psychiatry and the key element of psychiatric practice. Education
              in psychopathology is affected by several unmet needs, such as
              lack of appropriate training in the use of psychometric
              instruments, lack of supervision, and lack of practical skills.",

              Disagreements were resolved in a consensus meeting or by another
              reviewer. RESULTS: A total of eight articles were eligible for
              inclusion. Two are randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and six are
              observational studies. The two RCTs included showed a greater
              efficacy of CBT compared to standard care on auditory

              As regards non RCT-studies, all papers included showed reduction
              on frequency and severity of AHs and distress related to them.
              However, the lack of content details within non-RCTs studies

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: One of the main cognitive models of positive symptoms
              in schizophrenia proposes that they arise through impaired
              self-monitoring. This is supported by evidence of behavioural
              deficits on tasks designed to engage self-monitoring, but these
              deficits could also result from an externalising response bias.
              We examined whether patients with hallucinations and delusions
              would demonstrate an externalising bias on a task that did not
              involve cognitive self-monitoring. METHOD: Participants passively
              listened (without speaking) to recordings of single adjectives
              spoken in their own and another person's voice, and made
              self/nonself judgements about their source. The acoustic quality
              of recorded speech was experimentally manipulated by altering the
              pitch. Fifteen patients with schizophrenia who were currently
              experiencing hallucinations and delusions, 13 patients with
              schizophrenia not experiencing current hallucinations and
              delusions and 15 healthy controls were compared. RESULTS: When
              listening to distorted words, patients with hallucinations and
              delusions were more likely than both the group with no
              hallucinations and delusions and the control group to misidentify
              their own speech as alien (i.e. spoken by someone else). Across
              the combined patient groups, the tendency to misidentify
              self-generated speech as alien was positively correlated with
              current severity of hallucinations but not with ratings of
              delusions or positive symptoms in general. CONCLUSIONS: These
              findings indicate that patients with hallucinations and delusions
              are prone to misidentifying their own verbal material as alien in
              a task which does not involve cognitive self-monitoring. This
              suggests that these symptoms are related to an externalising bias
              in the processing of sensory material, and not solely a function
              of defective self-monitoring.",

  abstract  = "Schizophrenia is often conceptualized by clinicians and
               researchers alike as a chronic illness with persisting,
               relapsing or deteriorating symptoms, and no hope for sustained
               remission and recovery of functioning. Countering this
               perspective, retrospective and prospective studies with both
               chronic and recent onset patients suggest that schizophrenia has
               a heterogeneous course, which can be favorably influenced by
               comprehensive and continuous treatment as well as personal
               factors such as family support and good neurocognitive
               functioning. The factors influencing recovery are mostly
               malleable through treatment and may often lead to a sustained
               remission of symptoms and normal or near-normal levels of
               functioning.To facilitate future research in this area, an
               operational definition of recovery from schizophrenia is
               proposed that includes symptom remission; full- or part-time
               involvement in work or school; independent living without
               supervision by family or surrogate caregivers; not fully
               dependent on financial support from disability insurance; and
               having friends with whom activities are shared on a regular
               basis. To satisfy the definition of recovery from the long-term
               illness of schizophrenia, each of the above criteria should be
               sustained for at least two consecutive years. For validation,
               these criteria were submitted to focus groups comprising
               clients, family members, practitioners, and researchers. Using
               this operational definition, a pilot study was conducted to
               identify the self-attributions, clinical characteristics and
               neurocognitive correlates of 23 individuals who have recovered
               from schizophrenia. The focus groups endorsed most of the
               criteria as being relevant to the construct of recovery,
               although there were differences between research investigators
               and others. The pilot study generated hypotheses for future
               testing, suggesting that quality of sustained treatment,
               near-normal neurocognition, and absence of the deficit syndrome
               were key factors associated with recovery. With operational
               definitions and variables identified as possible facilitators of
               recovery, both hypothesis-generating and testing research can
               proceed with the aim to identify factors that are malleable and
               can become targets for therapeutic intervention. There are many
               extant, evidence-based biobehavioral treatments, as well as
               mental health service systems for their delivery, that could
               form the basis for rapid progress in promoting recovery.
               However, obstacles would have to be overcome to the
               dissemination, re-invention and utilization of empirically
               validated treatments, while rigorous, controlled research on
               determinants of recovery are simultaneously begun.",

              meta-analysis with correlation coefficients was used to pool the

              which 33 samples met our predefined selection criteria. Long DUP
              correlated statistically significantly with poor general
              symptomatic outcome, more severe positive and negative symptoms,
              lesser likelihood of remission and poor social functioning and
              global outcome (correlations 0.13-0.18). Long DUP was not
              associated with employment, quality of life or hospital
              treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The small but mostly consistent
              correlation between long DUP and poor outcome indicates that
              early intervention in psychosis may have at least subtle positive
              effects on the long-term course of illness.",

              individual who experiences them. However, there are limitations
              concerning the use of self-report instruments for capturing
              experiences that are of highly personal nature. The aim of this
              study was to provide a deeper understanding of how individuals
              with psychosis make sense of the content of their psychotic
              symptoms. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with
              12 individuals, some of whom were experiencing active symptoms
              and some of whom had experienced symptoms within the last 12
              months. The interviews explored the individuals' understanding of
              psychotic symptoms in terms of the content and the possible
              meaning of the content. All participants were patients at a unit
              specializing in psychosis. The study applied interpretive
              phenomenological analyses to highlight the subjective
              understanding of the content of psychotic symptoms. RESULTS:
              Interpersonal experiences were a consistent theme in
              participants' understanding of the content of their psychotic
              symptoms. Grandiose content was understood as being related to
              lack of relationships and helplessness, whereas harassing content
              was related to experiences of being abused. Commanding content
              was linked to emotional consequences of intrusive relationships
              and to distressing life events. Supportive content was viewed as
              a substitute for real-life persons. CONCLUSIONS: These results
              support previous findings suggesting that the content of
              psychotic symptoms is related to interpersonal experiences. The

              dose needed for the acute-phase treatment of schizophrenia is
              also necessary for relapse prevention. AIM: To compare the
              efficacy between standard dose [(World Health Organization daily

              DATA SOURCE: Double-blind, randomized, controlled trials with a
              follow-up duration of $\geq$24 weeks, including $\geq$2 dosage
              groups of the same antipsychotic drug for relapse prevention in
              schizophrenia, were searched using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central
              Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE (last search: August
              2009). DATA EXTRACTION: Data on overall treatment failure,
              hospitalization, relapse, and dropouts due to side effects were
              extracted and combined in a meta-analysis. DATA SYNTHESIS:
              Thirteen studies with 1395 subjects were included in this
              meta-analysis. Compared with the standard-dose treatment, the
              low-dose therapy did not show any statistically significant
              difference in overall treatment failure or hospitalization, while
              the standard dose showed a trend-level (P = .05) superiority in
              risk of relapse. The very low-dose group was inferior to the

              When the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) or the Positive

              Glutamatergic activity appears to be increased in the early
              phases of schizophrenia and may contribute to these structural
              alterations through an excitotoxic effect. The primary aim of
              this review was to describe the possible role of
              glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in explaining the presence of
              neuroanatomical changes within schizophrenia. A
              Medline(\textregistered{}) literature search was conducted,
              identifying English language studies on the topic of
              glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in schizophrenia, using the
              terms ``schizophreni'' and ``glutam'' and ((``MRS'' or ``MRI'' or
              ``magnetic resonance'') or (``computed tomography'' or ``CT'')).
              Studies concomitantly investigating glutamatergic activity and
              brain structure in patients with schizophrenia were included.
              Results are discussed in the context of findings from preclinical
              studies. Seven studies were identified that met the inclusion
              criteria. These studies provide inconclusive support for the role
              of glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in the occurrence of
              structural changes within schizophrenia, with the caveat that
              there is a paucity of human studies investigating this topic.
              Preclinical data suggest that an excitotoxic effect may occur as
              a result of a paradoxical increase in glutamatergic activity
              following N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor hypofunction. Based on
              animal literature, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity may account
              for certain structural changes present in schizophrenia, but
              additional human studies are required to substantiate these
              findings. Future studies should adopt a longitudinal design and
              employ magnetic resonance imaging techniques to investigate
              whether an association between glutamatergic activity and

  abstract = "Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe psychotic disorder that is highly
              heritable and common in the general population. The genetic
              heterogeneity of SZ is substantial, with contributions from
              common, rare, and de novo variants, in addition to environmental
              factors. Large genome-wide association studies have detected many
              variants that are associated with SZ, yet the pathways by which
              these variants influence risk remain largely unknown. SZ is also
              clinically heterogeneous, with patients exhibiting a broad range
              of deficits and symptom severity that vary over the course of
              illness and treatment, which has complicated efforts to identify
              risk variants. However, the underlying brain dysfunction forms a
              more stable trait marker that quantitative neurocognitive and
              neurophysiological endophenotypes may be able to objectively
              measure. These endophenotypes are less likely to be heterogeneous
              than the disorder and provide a neurobiological context to detect
              risk variants and underlying pathways among genes associated with
              SZ diagnosis. Furthermore, many endophenotypes are translational
              into animal model systems, allowing for direct evaluation of the
              neural circuit dysfunctions and neurobiological substrates. We
              review a selection of the most promising SZ endophenotypes,

              neuregulin and glutamate pathways, in several of these
              endophenotypes. Although endophenotypes require additional time
              and effort to assess, the insight into the underlying
              neurobiology that they provide may ultimately reveal the

              affecting insight. On the other hand, executive function may not
              be affected significantly by psychopathology, but executive
              function still plays an important role in determining the QoL not
              only directly, but also indirectly by influencing self-evaluation
              of side-effects. Impaired insight and executive function caused
              by severe level of psychopathology contribute to an increased
              reporting of side-effects, resulting in cumulative dysfunction in
              daily life for patients with chronic schizophrenia. Our study
              illustrates that the complexity of the relationships among the
              predictors of QoL in chronic patients of schizophrenia should be
              considered when designing studies on QoL of this group.",

              progeria, that is, some but not all aspects of accelerated aging

              Problems with matching and confounding may account for some of
              these discrepancies. Given the etiopathophysiological
              heterogeneity of schizophrenia, it is possible that only a

              associated with progeroid features, while others are not, or that
              one group is associated with a particular segment of aging
              features, while other progeroid features are found in another
              pathophysiological subgroup. In the aging research field,
              significant progress has been made in identifying the molecular

              premised on a mutual respect for the diversity of values,

  author   = "Malik, Peter",
  abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sexual dysfunctions have been described as
              being common in schizophrenia patients. The pathophysiology
              behind their development remains unclear. They can be secondary
              to the disease itself or an adverse event of antipsychotic
              medication. Therapeutic interventions are also not well studied.
              RECENT FINDINGS: Earlier work has suggested that
              second-generation antipsychotics bear fewer risks for developing
              sexual dysfunction because of a lower propensity to elevate
              prolactin levels, although the latter does not apply to
              amisulpride and risperidone. Only a few controlled trials with
              larger patient samples have been performed in the past. SUMMARY:
              The review covers studies published from March 2005 to June 2006
              focusing on sexual dysfunctions in schizophrenia patients, as
              well as their possible causes. Treatment options and the impact
              of sexual dysfunction on quality of life are also covered. The
              reviewed papers show no clear consistency regarding potential
              advantages of one drug over another. Many trials suffer from
              small sample sizes. The field badly needs more and larger studies

              little practical attention to training in it, and no specific
              theory of what constitutes good communication in psychiatry has
              been developed. This review aims to identify principles that
              guide good communication. METHODS: A conceptual review of guiding
              principles for how clinicians should communicate with patients to
              achieve clinical objectives in psychiatry. RESULTS: Five guiding
              principles for clinicians were identified: a focus on the

              appropriate involvement of patients in decision making;

              in psychotic disorders has emerged. Initially, the early
              psychosis movement focused on timely recognition and
              phase-specific treatment of first-episode psychosis. However,
              early psychosis researchers suspected that pushing the point of
              intervention even further back to the prodromal phase of
              psychotic disorders may result in even better outcomes. This
              article reviews intervention research in the ultra-high-risk
              phase of psychotic disorders. DATA SOURCES: A literature search
              of intervention trials with ultra-high-risk cohorts published
              after 1980 was conducted on PubMed with the search terms prodrome
              and intervention. STUDY SELECTION: All published intervention
              trials with ultra-high-risk cohorts. DATA SYNTHESIS: The first
              generation of intervention trials indicated that both
              pharmacologic and psychological intervention strategies may be of
              value in terms of symptom reduction and delay or prevention of
              onset of threshold psychotic disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Further
              controlled intervention trials with larger sample sizes are
              required in order to confirm and extend these findings. We argue
              that the clinical staging model provides a framework for the
              rationale and design of such studies, with simpler, safer, and
              more benign interventions being better candidates for first-line
              treatment, while more complex and potentially harmful treatments
              should be reserved for those cases in which response has failed
              to occur. Recent evidence indicates that neuroprotective agents,
              such as essential fatty acids, may be a suitable form of
              intervention for the ultra-high-risk phase of psychotic
              disorders, with a positive risk-benefit balance. Ethical aspects
              have become more salient given the recently observed declining
              transition rate in ultra-high-risk samples. We outline the key

              Palliative psychiatry focuses on mental health rather than

              depressions and repeated suicide attempts, and those with severe
              long-standing therapy-refractory anorexia nervosa. An explicitly
              palliative approach within psychiatry has the potential to
              improve quality of care, person-centredness, outcomes, and
              autonomy for patients with severe persistent mental illness.
              CONCLUSIONS: The first step towards a palliative psychiatry is to
              acknowledge those palliative approaches that already exist
              implicitly in psychiatry. Basic skills for a palliative
              psychiatry include communication of diagnosis and prognosis,
              symptom assessment and management, support for advance (mental
              health) care planning, assessment of caregiver needs, and
              referral to specialized services. Some of these may already be
              considered core skills of psychiatrists, but for a truly
              palliative approach they should be exercised guided by an
              awareness of the limited functional prognosis and lifespan of
              patients with severe persistent mental illness.",

              report longitudinal estimates of progression from less to more
              severe stages. METHODS: The study uses cross-sectional and
              longitudinal assessments of young people managed in specialized
              youth clinics. On the basis of clinical records, subjects were
              assigned to a specific clinical 'stage' (i.e. 'help-seeking',
              'attenuated syndrome', 'discrete disorder' or 'persistent or
              recurrent illness'). RESULTS: Young people (n = 209, mean age =
              19.9 years (range = 12-30 years), 48\% female) were selected from
              a broader cohort of n = 1483 subjects. Ten percent were assigned
              to the earliest 'help-seeking' stage, 54\% to the 'attenuated
              syndrome' stage, 25\% to the 'discrete disorder' stage and 11\%
              to the later 'persistent or recurrent illness' stage. The
              interrater reliability of independent ratings at baseline was
              acceptable ($\kappa$ = 0.71). Subjects assigned to the
              'attenuated syndrome' stage reported symptom and disability
              scores that were similar to those assigned to later stages.
              Longitudinally (median = 48 weeks), transition to later clinical
              stages were 11\% of the 'help-seeking', 19\% of the 'attenuated

              Among young people presenting for mental health care, most are
              clinically staged as having 'attenuated syndromes'. Despite

              machine-learning algorithm tailored for resting-state

              largest imaging-coupled, placebo-controlled antidepressant study

              This sertraline-predictive EEG signature generalized to two

  abstract = "Background: Nocebo effects contribute to a large proportion of
              the non-specific side-effects attributed to medications and are
              mainly generated through negative expectations. Previous reviews
              show that interventions designed to change participants'
              expectations have a small effect on pain experience. They are
              also effective in reducing side-effects caused by exposure to
              sham medications. To date, there has been no review of the
              influence of such interventions on symptoms attributed to real
              medicinal treatments. Objective: To review studies using a
              randomized controlled design testing the effect of brief
              psychological interventions compared to usual practice on the
              side-effect experience to medicinal treatments in healthy
              volunteers and patients. Methods: We searched Web of Science,
              Scopus, Medline, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and Cochrane CENTRAL
              using search terms for randomized controlled trials along with
              ``nocebo,'' ``placebo effect,'' ``medication,'' ``side-effects,''
              and associated terms. Studies were eligible if they studied a
              human population, used an active medicine, delivered a brief
              psychological intervention intended to influence side-effect
              reporting compared to usual care or no intervention, and used a
              randomized controlled design. Because of the heterogeneity of the
              literature we used a narrative synthesis and assessed evidence
              quality using the GRADE approach. Results: Our database search
              and supplementary search of the reference sections of included
              studies retrieved 50,140 citations. After screening, full text
              review and manual reference searches, 27 studies were included.
              The quality of the studies and evidence was judged to be low. The
              strongest and most consistent effect came from omitting
              side-effect information, although surprisingly de-emphasizing
              side-effects did not affect side-effect reporting. Other
              techniques, including priming, distraction, and altering the
              perception of branding, produced mixed results. Conclusion: Brief
              psychological interventions can influence side-effect reporting
              to active medications. Research is currently investigating new
              ways to de-emphasize side-effects whilst still upholding informed
              consent, but larger confirmatory trials with suitable control
              groups are needed. The literature in this area would be improved
              by more detailed reporting of studies.",

              observation that there does not appear to be a direct

              damage and the clinical manifestation of that damage. This paper
              attempts to develop a coherent theoretical account of reserve.
              One convenient subdivision of reserve models revolves around
              whether they envision reserve as a passive process, such as in
              brain reserve or threshold, or see the brain as actively
              attempting to cope with or compensate for pathology, as in
              cognitive reserve. Cognitive reserve may be based on more
              efficient utilization of brain networks or of enhanced ability to
              recruit alternate brain networks as needed. A distinction is
              suggested between reserve, the ability to optimize or maximize

              performance in the face of brain damage by using brain structures
              or networks not engaged when the brain is not damaged.

              with and without demonstrable pathology and labeled,

              those with software versus hardware problems? I propose 11
              categories of difference-makers for psychiatric illness from
              molecular genetics through culture and review their distribution

              presenting with potentially prodromal symptoms. The importance of
              this HR state has been increasingly recognized to such an extent
              that a new syndrome is being considered as a diagnostic category
              in the DSM-5. OBJECTIVE: To reframe the HR state in a
              comprehensive state-of-the-art review on the progress that has
              been made while also recognizing the challenges that remain. DATA
              SOURCES: Available HR research of the past 20 years from PubMed,
              books, meetings, abstracts, and international conferences. STUDY
              SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Critical review of HR studies
              addressing historical development, inclusion criteria,
              epidemiologic research, transition criteria, outcomes, clinical
              and functional characteristics, neurocognition, neuroimaging,
              predictors of psychosis development, treatment trials,
              socioeconomic aspects, nosography, and future challenges in the
              field. DATA SYNTHESIS: Relevant articles retrieved in the
              literature search were discussed by a large group of leading
              worldwide experts in the field. The core results are presented
              after consensus and are summarized in illustrative tables and
              figures. CONCLUSIONS: The relatively new field of HR research in
              psychosis is exciting. It has the potential to shed light on the
              development of major psychotic disorders and to alter their
              course. It also provides a rationale for service provision to
              those in need of help who could not previously access it and the
              possibility of changing trajectories for those with vulnerability
              to psychotic illnesses.",

  abstract = "Schizophrenia is a long-term psychiatric disorder that impacts
              important mental functions and requires indefinite treatment, as
              well as psychosocial and economic support. The introduction of
              chlorpromazine, the first antipsychotic, and the subsequent
              development of a long list of similar dopamine-blocking
              antipsychotic medications, has changed the treatment of
              schizophrenia as medications have become the cornerstone of
              clinical management. The enthusiasm that greeted the introduction
              of antipsychotics was soon tempered by the realisation that they
              induced significant side effects, such as extrapyramidal and
              autonomic symptoms. A less-recognized side effect at the time was
              the emergence of subtle subjective side effects that led patients
              to dislike medications and eventually discontinue them, with
              serious consequences of frequent relapses requiring
              hospitalization, poor outcomes and more health costs. The
              development of our dedicated programme for research into
              subjective tolerability to medications over the past 30 years has
              allowed us to establish the validity of the construct of
              'subjective tolerability' to antipsychotics, applying research
              methodologies that are required for any scientific inquiry. We
              clarified definitions, developed reliable measuring tools, and
              constructed psychosocial and neurobiological conceptual models.
              We also documented the serious consequences of negative
              subjective tolerability to antipsychotics: poor medication
              adherence behaviour, impaired quality of life, and worse clinical
              and functional outcomes. More recently, using neuroimaging
              techniques, we and other international research groups were able
              to clearly elucidate the neurobiology of dysphoric negative
              subjective responses, linking it to low dopamine functioning in
              the striatal region of the brain. Such a discovery for the first
              time allowed us to also link the development of comorbid drug
              abuse in schizophrenia, which is a common occurrence, to the
              development of neuroleptic dysphoria, since both relate to the
              low dopamine function in the striatum. As an already validated
              scientific concept that has serious consequences, subjective
              tolerability to antipsychotics can serve as a model for
              patient-centered outcomes that really matter. Our long-serving
              research programme also illustrates the value of clinical
              observations to the development of important clinical research
              studies, i.e. from the bedside to the research bench, and back to

              everything 'psychotic' is observed, even affective states with
              mild psychosis labelled 'ultra-high risk' (for schizophrenia).
              The inability of psychiatry to frame psychosis as

              period which management is important in determining the long-term
              outcome of the schizophrenia (SCZ). For this reason, the duration
              of untreated illness (DUI), defined as the interval between the
              onset of the psychiatric disorder and the administration of the
              first pharmacological treatment, is a clinical variable that has
              been increasingly investigated due to its potentially modifiable
              nature and its value as a predictor of outcome. DUI is poorly
              applicable and highly unreliable in psychosis. The present
              critical review examines the impact of DUI and its more operative
              definition of ``duration of untreated psychosis'' (DUP) in the
              course and outcome of SCZ, focusing on its epidemiologic,
              clinical, prognostic factors. Length of DUP has been identified
              as positively related to a worst treatment response, symptom
              control and overall functional outcome in SCZ. Negative symptoms
              appear to be prominently related to longer DUP. Neuroimaging
              correlates of DUP have not been clearly outlined: few of the
              studies considering first-episode patients and DUP showed
              structural abnormalities. A low proportion of significant
              associations were found mostly in cerebellum and occipital lobe
              of patients with longer DUP. Also, evidence of an inverse
              correlation between cognitive alterations and DUP is not
              conclusive. DUI and DUP are multidimensional constructs that
              imply both intrinsic, illness related (e.g. subtle symptoms at
              onset) and extrinsic factors (e.g. access to mental health
              services), so that from its study sprouted in the last decades

              SCZ such as providing a timely diagnosis and treatment to

              intervention seems to ensure a shortened DUP, especially for
              people presenting with brief limited intermittent psychotic
              symptoms, and, ultimately, ensure a more favorable prognosis for

              version (SPI-A), the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk
              Syndromes (SIPS), and the Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale

              One hundred thirty-one patients of a Voices Clinic and 65 members
              of the Dutch Resonance Foundation were assessed with the Positive
              and Useful Voices Inquiry. Data were analyzed using Pearson's

              RESULTS: First voices are most often reported as negative.
              Positive voices occur more among non-psychotic subjects, but the
              specific characteristics and diagnosis are not significantly
              associated. Lifetime prevalence of positive and useful voices
              ranged between 40\% and 60\%, with varied prevalence rates over

              significantly associated with the wish to preserve them.
              Attribution of protective power to positive voices has the

              prior studies have been inconsistent. This study aimed to
              estimate the relationship between schizophrenia and incident
              dementia using a quantitative meta-analysis. Methods: Several
              databases were used to gather relevant information, including
              PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, with the publication date of
              articles limited up to December 23, 2017. All studies reported a
              multivariate-adjusted estimate, represented as relative risk (RR)
              with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), for the association between
              schizophrenia and risk of dementia incidence. Pooled RRs were
              calculated using a random-effects model. Results: Six studies met
              our inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis, which included
              206,694 cases of dementia and 5,063,316 participants. All
              individuals were without dementia at baseline. Overall, the
              quantitative meta-analysis suggested that subjects with
              schizophrenia were associated with a significantly greater risk
              of dementia incidence (RR 2.29; 95\% CI 1.35-3.88) than those
              without. Conclusion: The results of this meta-analysis indicate
              that individuals with schizophrenia may have an increased risk
              for the development of dementia. Future studies should explore
              whether schizophrenia is a modifiable risk factor for dementia.",

              information-processing. According to this, schizophrenia-like
              psychotic phenomena develop in three phases. In the first,
              premorbid phase, combined biological (genetic and possibly other
              organic) and psycho-social influences lead to a premorbid
              'vulnerability', characterised by a low tolerance of cognitive
              and emotional stress, corresponding to an insufficient capacity
              for the adequate processing of complex information. In the second
              phase, stressful life-events can lead to unique or repeated acute
              productive psychotic episodes. The third phase, that of long-term
              evolution, depends more on psycho-social influences than on
              biological factors. Under unfavourable conditions, it may lead to
              predominantly unproductive residual states of various degrees,
              which can largely be understood as regulatory mechanisms to
              restrict stressful over-stimulation. There is no clearly

  abstract = "Schizophrenia (SZ) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a broad
              symptomatology, including cognitive symptoms that are thought to
              arise from the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The neurobiological
              aetiology of these symptoms remains elusive, yet both impaired
              redox control and PFC dysconnectivity have been recently
              implicated. PFC dysconnectivity has been linked to white matter,
              oligodendrocyte (OL) and myelin abnormalities in SZ patients.
              Myelin is produced by mature OLs, and OL precursor cells (OPCs)
              are exceptionally susceptible to oxidative stress. Here we
              propose a hypothesis for the aetiology of cognitive
              symptomatology in SZ: the redox-induced prefrontal
              OPC-dysfunctioning hypothesis. We pose that the combination of
              genetic and environmental factors causes oxidative stress marked
              by a build-up of reactive oxygen species that, during late
              adolescence, impair OPC signal transduction processes that are
              necessary for OPC proliferation and differentiation, and involve
              AMP-activated protein kinase, Akt-mTOR-P70S6K and peroxisome
              proliferator receptor alpha signalling. OPC dysfunctioning
              coincides with the relatively late onset of PFC myelination,
              causing hypomyelination and disruption of connectivity in this
              brain area. The resulting cognitive deficits arise in parallel
              with SZ onset. Hence, our hypothesis provides a novel
              neurobiological framework for the aetiology of SZ cognitive
              symptoms. Future research addressing our hypothesis could have
              important implications for the development of new (combined)
              antioxidant- and promyelination-based strategies to treat the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The concept of staging of disease in psychiatry has
              developed over the past years. A neglected component of this
              model pertains to people in the advanced stages of a mental
              illness, who remain symptomatic and functionally impaired despite
              treatment. These patients are often high service utilizers,
              receiving complex multimodal treatments where the balance of risk
              and benefit shifts perceptibly. In this paper, we argue the need
              to adopt 'palliative' models of care for some individuals, and
              consider changing the therapeutic goals to follow care pathways
              similar to those used in other chronic and refractory medical
              illnesses. METHOD: Data was sourced by a literature search using
              Medline and a hand search of scientific journals. Relevant
              articles were selected. RESULTS: Clinical staging can help us
              better define subgroups of patients who will benefit from
              different goals and treatment. In the most advanced stage group,
              we find patients with persistent symptoms and treatment
              resistance. In these situations, it may be preferable to follow
              some of the principles of palliative care, which include the
              setting of attainable goals, reduction of side-effects, limited
              symptom control, targeting identified psychological and social
              problems, and attempting to attain the best quality of life for
              these patients and their families. CONCLUSIONS: It is in the
              interest of those in the advanced phases of a disorder that
              clinicians acknowledge the limitations of treatment and actively
              attempt to plan treatment utilizing alternate models. It is
              essential to be clear that such approaches do not equate to the
              abandonment of care, but rather to the reconceptualizing of
              feasible and personalized treatment goals, a rebalancing of the
              risks and benefits of intervention, the management of illness

              of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. METHODS: Patients
              with first-episode schizophrenia were assessed on measures of
              psychopathologic variables, cognition, social functioning, and
              biological variables and treated according to a standardized
              algorithm. The sample for the relapse analyses consisted of 104
              patients who responded to treatment of their index episode and
              were at risk for relapse. RESULTS: Five years after initial
              recovery, the cumulative first relapse rate was 81.9\% (95\%
              confidence interval [CI], 70.6\%-93.2\%); the second relapse rate
              was 78.0\% (95\% CI, 46.5\%-100.0\%). By 4 years after recovery
              from a second relapse, the cumulative third relapse rate was
              86.2\% (95\% CI, 61.5\%-100.0\%). Discontinuing antipsychotic
              drug therapy increased the risk of relapse by almost 5 times
              (hazard ratio for an initial relapse, 4.89 [99\% CI, 2.49-9.60];
              hazard ratio for a second relapse, 4.57 [99\% CI, 1.49-14.02]).
              Subsequent analyses controlling for antipsychotic drug use showed
              that patients with poor premorbid adaptation to school and
              premorbid social withdrawal relapsed earlier. Sex, diagnosis,
              obstetric complications, duration of psychotic illness before
              treatment, baseline symptoms, neuroendocrine measures,

              neuropsychologic and magnetic resonance imaging measures, time to
              response of the initial episode, adverse effects during
              treatment, and presence of residual symptoms after the initial
              episode were not significantly related to time to relapse.
              CONCLUSIONS: There is a high rate of relapse within 5 years of
              recovery from a first episode of schizophrenia and
              schizoaffective disorder. This risk is diminished by maintenance

  abstract = "Relapse in patients with schizophrenia has devastating
              repercussions, including worsening symptoms, impaired
              functioning, cognitive deterioration and reduced quality of life.
              This progressive decline exacerbates the burden of illness on
              patients and their families. Relapse prevention is identified as
              a key therapeutic aim; however, the absence of widely accepted
              relapse definition criteria considerably hampers achieving this
              goal. We conducted a literature review in order to investigate
              the reporting of relapses and the validity of hospitalization as
              a proxy for relapse in patients with schizophrenia. The primary
              aim was to assess the range and validity of methods used to
              define relapse in observational or naturalistic settings. The
              secondary aim was to capture information on factors that
              predicted or influenced the risk of relapse. A structured search
              of the PubMed database identified articles that discussed
              relapse, and hospitalization as a proxy of relapse, in patients
              with schizophrenia. National and international guidelines were
              also reviewed. Of the 150 publications and guidelines identified,
              87 defined relapse and 62\% of these discussed hospitalization.
              Where hospitalization was discussed, this was as a proxy for, or
              a component of, relapse in the majority of cases. However,
              hospitalization duration and type varied and were not always well
              defined. Scales were used to define relapse in 53 instances; 10
              different scales were used and multiple scales often appeared
              within the same definition. There were 95 references to factors
              that may drive relapse, including non-adherence to antipsychotic
              medication (21/95), stress/depression (11/95) and substance abuse
              (9/95). Twenty-five publications discussed the potential of
              antipsychotic therapy to reduce relapse rates-continuous
              antipsychotic therapy was associated with reduced frequency and
              duration of hospitalization. Non-pharmacological interventions,
              such as psychoeducation and cognitive behavioural therapy, were
              also commonly reported as factors that may reduce relapse. In
              conclusion, this review identified numerous factors used to
              define relapse. Hospitalization was the factor most frequently
              used and represents a useful proxy for relapse when reporting in
              a naturalistic setting. Several factors were reported to increase
              the risk of relapse, and observation of these may aid the
              identification of at-risk patients.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Although continuous treatment with antipsychotics is
              still recommended as the gold standard treatment paradigm for all
              patients with schizophrenia, some clinicians question whether
              continuous antipsychotic treatment is necessary, or even
              justified, for every patient with schizophrenia who has been
              stabilized on antipsychotics. OBJECTIVE: The primary objectives
              of this systematic review and meta-analysis were (i) to compare
              relapse/hospitalization risks of stabilized patients with
              schizophrenia under active versus intermittent or placebo
              treatment conditions; (ii) to examine the role of several study
              characteristics, possibly intervening in the relationship between
              relapse risk and treatment condition; and (iii) to examine
              whether time to relapse is associated with antipsychotic
              treatment duration. METHODS: A systematic literature search,
              using the MEDLINE database (1950 until November 2014), was
              conducted for English-language published randomized controlled
              trials, covering a follow-up time period of at least 6 months,
              and investigating relapse/rehospitalization and/or
              time-to-relapse rates with placebo or intermittent treatment
              strategies versus continuous treatment with oral and long-acting
              injectable first- or second-generation antipsychotics (FGAs/SGAs)
              in stabilized patients with schizophrenia. Additional studies
              were identified through searches of reference lists of other
              identified systematic reviews and Cochrane reports. Two
              meta-analyses (placebo versus continuous and intermittent versus
              continuous treatment) were performed to obtain an optimal
              estimation of the relapse/hospitalization risks of stabilized
              patients with schizophrenia under these treatment conditions and
              to assess the role of study characteristics. For time-to-relapse
              data, a descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS: Forty-eight
              reports were selected as potentially eligible for our
              meta-analysis. Of these, 21 met the inclusion criteria.
              Twenty-five records, identified through Cochrane and other
              systematic reviews and fulfilling the inclusion criteria, were
              added, resulting in a total of 46 records. Stabilized patients
              with schizophrenia who have been exposed for at least 6 months to
              intermittent or placebo strategies, respectively, have a 3 (odds
              ratio [OR] 3.36; 95\% CI 2.36-5.45; p < 0.0001) to 6 (OR 5.64;
              95\% CI 4.47-7.11; p < 0.0001) times increased risk of relapse,
              compared with patients on continuous treatment. The availability
              of rescue medication (p = 0.0102) was the only study
              characteristic explaining systematic differences in the OR for
              relapse between placebo versus continuous treatment across
              studies. Studies reporting time-to-relapse data show that the
              time to (impending) relapse is always significantly delayed with
              continuous treatment, compared with placebo or intermittent
              treatment strategies. Although the interval between treatment
              discontinuation and symptom recurrence can be highly variable,
              mean time-to-relapse data seem to indicate a failure of clinical
              stability before 7-14 months with intermittent and before 5
              months with placebo treatment strategies. For all reports
              included in this systematic review, median time-to-relapse rates
              in the continuous treatment group were not estimable as <50\% of
              the patients in this treatment condition relapsed before the end
              of the study. CONCLUSIONS: With continuous treatment, patients
              have a lower risk of relapse and remain relapse free for a longer
              period of time compared with placebo and intermittent treatment
              strategies. Moreover, 'success rates' in the intermittent
              treatment conditions are expected to be an overestimate of actual
              outcome rates. Therefore, continuous treatment remains the 'gold
              standard' for good clinical practice, particularly as, until now,
              only a few and rather general valid predictors for relapse in
              schizophrenia are known and subsequent relapses may contribute to
              functional deterioration as well as treatment resistance in
              patients with schizophrenia.",

  abstract = "Importance: Since the release of the DSM-5 diagnosis of
              attenuated psychosis syndrome (DSM-5-APS) in 2013, several
              research studies have investigated its clinical validity.
              Although critical and narrative reviews have reviewed these
              progresses, no systematic review has comprehensively summarized
              the available evidence regarding the clinical validity of
              DSM-5-APS. Objective: To provide current evidence on the clinical
              validity of DSM-5-APS, focusing on recent advances in diagnosis,
              prognosis, and treatment. Evidence Review: A multistep literature
              search using the Web of Science database, Cochrane Central
              Register of Reviews, Ovid/PsychINFO, conference proceedings, and
              trial registries from database inception to June 16, 2019, was
              conducted following PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines and PROSPERO
              protocol. Studies with original data investigating individuals
              diagnosed using DSM-5-APS or meeting comparable criteria were
              included. The results of the systematic review were summarized in
              tables and narratively synthesized against established
              evidence-based antecedent, concurrent, and prognostic validators.
              A quantitative meta-analysis was conducted to explore the
              cumulative risk of psychosis onset at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months in
              individuals diagnosed using DSM-5-APS criteria. Findings: The
              systematic review included 56 articles, which reported on 124
              validators, including 15 antecedent, 55 concurrent, and 54
              prognostic validators. The epidemiological prevalence of the
              general non-help-seeking young population meeting DSM-5-APS
              criteria was 0.3\%; the prevalence of individuals meeting
              DSM-5-APS criteria was variable in clinical samples. The
              interrater reliability for DSM-5-APS criteria was comparable with
              that of other DSM-5 mental disorders and can be optimized by the
              use of specific psychometric instruments. DSM-5-APS criteria were
              associated with frequent depressive comorbid disorders, distress,
              suicidality, and functional impairment. The meta-analysis
              included 23 prospective cohort studies, including 2376
              individuals. The meta-analytical risk of psychosis onset was 11\%
              at 6 months, 15\% at 12 months, 20\% at 24 months, and 23\% at 36
              months. Research into predisposing and precipitating
              epidemiological factors, neurobiological correlates, and
              effective treatments for DSM-5-APS criteria has been limited.
              Conclusions and Relevance: Over recent years, DSM-5-APS criteria
              have received substantial concurrent and prognostic validation,
              mostly driven by research into the clinical high-risk state for
              psychosis. Precipitating and predisposing factors,
              neurobiological correlates, and effective treatments are

              of literature which presents an alternative view of psychosis,

              can also experience transformative and/or spiritual growth
              through psychosis. To learn more about the transformative
              potential of psychotic experiences, a phenomenological approach
              was used to research the experiences of six people who
              self-identified as having benefited from psychosis in a spiritual
              and/or transformative manner. Keys themes emerging from
              interviews with these six individuals included in the
              pre-psychosis phase ``childhood foreshadowing'' and ``negative
              childhood events,'' and in the psychosis phase, ``sudden

              experiences,'' ``comprised day-to-day functioning,''
              ``experiences of dying,'' and ``communication with god.'' Four

              psychosis, clinical and research programmes would benefit from a
              conceptual clarification of how to operationalize 'first-episode
              psychosis'. We review the variety of definitions in use and
              discuss their relative merits with respect to both clinical (e.g.
              early treatment) and research (e.g. obtaining meaningfully
              homogeneous populations) agendas. METHODS: We completed a
              selective review of the literature to investigate how
              first-episode psychosis was operationally defined. RESULTS:
              Operational definitions for 'first-episode psychosis' fall
              largely into three categories: (i) first treatment contact; (ii)
              duration of antipsychotic medication use; and (iii) duration of
              psychosis. Each definitional category contains a number of
              underlying assumptions that contribute to the strengths and
              weaknesses of the definition. CONCLUSIONS: The term
              'first-episode psychosis' as used within clinical and research
              settings is misleading regardless of which operational definition
              is used. This term is typically used to refer to individuals
              early in the course of a psychotic illness or treatment rather
              than individuals who are truly in the midst of a first 'episode'
              of illness. The alternative of 'recent-onset psychosis' with
              related definitions based on 'duration of psychosis' is proposed.
              Based on this review, we provide suggestions with regard to the

              important issue of the current psychiatric research is to
              identify the specific factors that contribute to impaired brain
              development and neurodegeneration in SCH and BD, and especially
              how these factors alter normal brain development and
              physiological aging process. Our hypothesis is that only specific
              damages, taking place in precise brain development stages, are
              associated with future SCH /BD onset and that neurodegeneration
              consists of an acceleration of brain aging after SCH /BD onset.
              In support of our hypothesis, the results of the present
              narrative mini-review shows as neurodevelopmental damages
              generally contribute to neuropsychiatric syndromes (e.g.
              hypothyroidism or treponema pallidum), but only some of them are
              specifically associated with adult SCH and BD (e.g. toxoplasma or
              substance abuse), particularly if they happen in specific stages
              of brain development. On the other hand, cognitive impairment and
              brain changes, associated with long duration of SCH /BD, look
              like what happens during aging: memory, executive domains and
              prefrontal cortex are implicated both in aging and in SCH /BD
              progression. Future research will explore possible validity of
              this etiological model for SCH and BD.",

              of recent meta-analyses",
  author   = "Haddad, Peter M and Correll, Christoph U",
  abstract = "Schizophrenia is the eighth leading cause of disability worldwide
              in people aged 15-44 years. Before antidopaminergic
              antipsychotics were introduced in the 1950s, no effective
              medications existed for the treatment of schizophrenia. This
              review summarizes key meta-analytic findings regarding
              antipsychotic efficacy in the acute treatment of schizophrenia,
              including clozapine in treatment-resistant patients. In the most
              comprehensive meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
              conducted in multi-episode schizophrenia, antipsychotics
              outperformed placebo regarding total symptoms, positive symptoms,
              negative symptoms, depressive symptoms, quality of life and
              social functioning. Amongst these outcomes, the standardized mean
              difference for overall symptoms was largest, that is, 0.47 (95\%
              credible interval = 0.42-0.51), approaching a medium effect size,
              being reduced to 0.38 when publication bias and small-trial
              effects were accounted for. A comparison of two meta-analyses
              indicated that first-episode patients, compared with
              multi-episode patients, were more likely to have at least minimal
              treatment response [⩾20\% Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
              (PANSS)/Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score reduction:
              81\% versus 51\%] and good response (⩾50\% PANSS/BPRS score
              reduction: 52\% versus 23\%). In multi-episode schizophrenia, no
              response or worsening after 2 weeks of a therapeutic
              antipsychotic dose was highly predictive of not achieving a good
              response at endpoint (median treatment = 6 weeks: specificity =
              86\%; positive predictive value = 90\%), suggesting a change in
              treatment should be considered in such cases. In first-episode
              psychosis, adequately dosed antipsychotic treatment trials for
              more than 2 weeks are recommended before using no response or
              worsening as a decision point for aborting a given antipsychotic.
              In clearly defined treatment-resistant schizophrenia, clozapine
              generally outperformed other antipsychotics, especially when
              dosed appropriately (target = 3-6 months' duration; trough
              clozapine level ⩾350-400 $\mu$g/L) with a response rate (⩾20\%
              PANSS/BPRS) of 33\% by 3 months of treatment. High antipsychotic
              doses and psychotropic combinations are unlikely to be superior
              to standard doses of antipsychotic monotherapy. Acute
              antipsychotic efficacy in schizophrenia depends on the targeted
              symptom domain (greater efficacy: total and positive symptoms,
              lesser efficacy: negative symptoms, depressive symptoms, social
              functioning and quality of life). Greater antipsychotic efficacy
              is associated with higher total baseline symptom severity,
              treatment-na{\"\i}vet{\'e}/first-episode status, shorter illness
              duration, and trials that are nonindustry sponsored and that have
              a lower placebo effect. The heterogeneity of antipsychotic
              response across individuals and key symptom domains, the
              considerable degree of nonresponse/treatment resistance in
              multi-episode patients, and the adverse effect potential of
              antipsychotics are major limitations, underscoring the need to
              develop new medications for the treatment of schizophrenia. Drug
              development should include matching patient subgroups, which are
              identified by means of clinical and biomarker variables, to
              mechanisms of action of novel medications, targeting specific
              symptom domains, and investigating mechanisms of action other
              than dopaminergic blockade.",

              Subjective Sense in Psychosis Questionnaire (SUSE) to measure
              sense making in psychotic disorders. METHOD: SUSE was based on an
              item pool generated by professionals and patients. For
              pre-testing, 90 psychosis patients completed the instrument.
              Psychometric properties were assessed using methods of classical
              test theory. In the main study, SUSE was administered to a
              representative sample of 400 patients. Factor structure,
              reliability and validity were assessed and confirmatory factor
              analyses (CFAs) were used for testing subscale coherence and
              adequacy of the hypothesized factor structure. Response effects
              due to clinical settings were tested using multilevel analyses.
              RESULTS: The final version of SUSE comprises 34 items measuring
              distinct aspects of the experience and meaning of psychoses in a
              consistent overall model with six coherent subscales representing
              positive and negative meanings throughout the course of psychotic
              disorders. Multilevel analyses indicate independence from
              clinical context effects. Patients relating psychotic experiences
              to life events assessed their symptoms and prospects more
              positively. 76\% of patients assumed a relationship between their
              biography and the emergence of psychosis, 42\% reported positive
              experience of symptoms and 74\% ascribed positive consequences to
              their psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: SUSE features good psychometric
              qualities and offers an empirical acquisition to subjective
              assessment of psychosis. The results highlight the significance
              of subjective meaning making in psychoses and support a more

              causes of death among persons diagnosed with schizophrenia and
              the general population in Finland during 1984-2014. METHODS: All
              persons with schizophrenia in Finland were identified from
              hospital discharge register, and compared with the Finnish
              population aged 16 years and older during 1984-2014, based on
              data from Statistics Finland. Age at death and standardized
              mortality ratio (SMR) were calculated for each follow-up year.
              RESULTS: Mean age at death increased from 57.6 years in 1984 to
              70.1 years in 2014 in persons with schizophrenia, and from 70.9
              to 77.5 years in the general population. All-cause SMR remained
              stable during the follow-up (2.6 in 1984 and 2.7 in 2014). A
              major change was observed in SMR for suicides which decreased
              from 11.0 in 1984 to 6.6 in 2014 (-40\%). The SMRs for

              prevalence of verbal and nonverbal communications between
              physical therapists and patients with back pain. SUBJECTS: Seven
              physical therapists and 21 patients with back pain participated
              in this study. METHODS: The first interaction following the
              initial assessment was recorded with a video camera. The outcome
              measures were the Medical Communications Behavior System (verbal
              communication) and frequencies of nonverbal behaviors
              (affirmative head nodding, smiling, eye gaze, forward leaning,
              and touch). Semistructured interviews were undertaken with the
              physical therapists to determine the perceived influence of the
              video camera. RESULTS: A total of 2,055 verbal statements were
              made. Physical therapists spent approximately twice as much time
              talking as patients, with content behaviors (such as taking
              history and giving advice) comprising 52\% of verbal
              communications. The most prevalent nonverbal behaviors were touch

              factors associated with schizophrenia relapse. METHODS: A
              research of the last 22 years of literature data was performed.
              Two-hundred nineteen studies have been included. RESULTS: Three
              main groups of factors are related to relapse: factors associated
              with pharmacological treatment, add-on psychotherapeutic
              treatments and general risk factors. Overall, the absence of a
              maintenance therapy and treatment with first generation
              antipsychotics has been associated with higher risk of relapse.
              Further, psychotherapy add-on, particularly with cognitive
              behaviour therapy and psycho-education for both patients and
              relatives, has shown a good efficacy for reducing the relapse
              rate. Among general risk factors, some could be modified, such as
              the duration of untreated psychosis or the substance misuse,
              while others could not be modified as male gender or low

              essential for prognostication in clinical settings, deployment of
              cognitive remediation, and public health policy. Objective: To
              examine long-term cognitive changes in individuals with psychotic
              disorders and to compare age-related differences in cognitive
              performance between people with psychotic disorders and matched
              control individuals (ie, individuals who had never had psychotic
              disorders). Design, Setting, and Participants: The Suffolk County
              Mental Health Project is an inception cohort study of
              first-admission patients with psychosis. Cognitive functioning
              was assessed 2 and 20 years later. Patients were recruited from
              the 12 inpatient facilities of Suffolk County, New York. At year
              20, the control group was recruited by random digit dialing and
              matched to the clinical cohort on zip code and demographics. Data
              were collected between September 1991 and July 2015. Analysis
              began January 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: Change in
              cognitive functioning in 6 domains: verbal knowledge (Wechsler
              Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised vocabulary test), verbal
              declarative memory (Verbal Paired Associates test I and II),
              visual declarative memory (Visual Reproduction test I and II),
              attention and processing speed (Symbol Digit Modalities
              Test-written and oral; Trail Making Test [TMT]-A),
              abstraction-executive function (Trenerry Stroop Color Word Test;
              TMT-B), and verbal fluency (Controlled Oral Word Association
              Test). Results: A total of 705 participants were included in the
              analyses (mean [SD] age at year 20, 49.4 [10.1] years): 445
              individuals (63.1\%) had psychotic disorders (211 with
              schizophrenia spectrum [138 (65\%) male]; 164 with affective
              psychoses [76 (46\%) male]; 70 with other psychoses [43 (61\%)
              male]); and 260 individuals (36.9\%) in the control group (50.5
              [9.0] years; 134 [51.5\%] male). Cognition in individuals with a
              psychotic disorder declined on all but 2 tests (average decline:
              d = 0.31; range, 0.17-0.54; all P < .001). Cognitive declines
              were associated with worsening vocational functioning (Visual
              Reproduction test II: r = 0.20; Symbol Digit Modalities
              Test-written: r = 0.25; Stroop: r = 0.24; P < .009) and worsening
              negative symptoms (avolition: Symbol Digit Modalities
              Test-written: r = -0.24; TMT-A: r = -0.21; Stroop: r = -0.21; all
              P < .009; inexpressivity: Stroop: r = -0.22; P < .009). Compared
              with control individuals, people with psychotic disrders showed
              age-dependent deficits in verbal knowledge, fluency, and
              abstraction-executive function (vocabulary: $\beta$ = -0.32;
              Controlled Oral Word Association Test: $\beta$ = -0.32; TMT-B:
              $\beta$ = 0.23; all P < .05), with the largest gap among
              participants 50 years or older. Conclusions and Relevance: In
              individuals with psychotic disorders, most cognitive functions
              declined over 2 decades after first hospitalization. Observed
              declines were clinically significant. Some declines were larger
              than expected due to normal aging, suggesting that cognitive
              aging in some domains may be accelerated in this population. If
              confirmed, these findings would highlight cognition as an
              important target for research and treatment during later phases
              of psychotic illness.",

              antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia, yet how 'relapse' is
              defined in trials is not well-known. METHODS: We conducted a
              systematic review of definitions of relapse in trials of
              continuous antipsychotic treatment compared with discontinuation,
              intermittent treatment or dose reduction for people with
              schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Trials were identified from
              previous Cochrane reviews and a new search. The quality of
              relapse definitions was rated in terms of reliability and
              clinical relevance and associations between quality of
              definitions and trial characteristics and outcome were explored.
              RESULTS: We identified 82 reports of 81 trials which employed 54
              different definitions of relapse. There were 33 definitions in
              the 35 trials published since 1990, with recent trials employing
              complex definitions often involving alternative criteria. Only
              ten primary definitions of relapse required the presence of
              psychotic symptoms in all cases, and only three specified this in
              combination with a measure of overall severity or functional
              decline. Only two definitions specified a duration longer than
              two days. Relapse definitions were rated as showing good
              reliability in 37 trials, but only seven showed good clinical
              relevance. Six trials with definitions that were both reliable
              and clinically relevant were slightly longer, but did not differ
              from remaining trials in other characteristics or overall or
              relative risk of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Antipsychotic trials
              define relapse in numerous different ways, and few definitions

              Hippocratic philosophy is that only some, not all, diseases
              should be treated and, even then, treatments should enhance the
              natural healing process, not serve as artificial cures.
              Hippocratic ethics follow from this philosophy of disease and
              treatment. Two rules for Hippocratic medicine are derived from
              the teachings of Osler (treat diseases, not symptoms) and Holmes
              (medications are guilty until proven innocent). The concept of a
              diagnostic hierarchy is also stated explicitly: Not all diseases
              are created equal. This idea helps to avoid mistaking symptoms
              for diseases and to avoid excessive diagnosis of comorbidities.
              Current psychopharmacology is aggressive and non-Hippocratic:
              symptom-based, rather than disease oriented; underemphasizing
              drug risks; and prone to turning symptoms into diagnoses. These
              views are applied to bipolar disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Contemporary
              psychopharmacology is non-Hippocratic. A proposal for moving in
              the direction of a Hippocratic psychopharmacology is provided.",

              CINAHL databases were systematically searched for studies
              allocating participants with insomnia symptoms (diagnosed or
              self-reported) to receive a placebo that they were led to believe
              was an active treatment or to a no treatment control group.
              Thirteen independent studies (n = 566) met inclusion criteria.
              Meta-analysis indicated a reliable placebo effect whereby placebo
              treatment led to improved perceived sleep onset latency (SOL;
              Hedges g = 0.272), total sleep time (TST; Hedges g = 0.322), and
              global sleep quality (GSQ; Hedges' g = 0.581), when compared with
              no treatment. There was no effect on objective assessment of SOL,
              however only a few studies reported this outcome and there were
              insufficient sample sizes to meta-analyse other objective
              outcomes. Moderator analysis indicated that the placebo effect

              schizophrenia who had switched to paliperidone extended release
              (ER). METHODS: A total of 291 patients with schizophrenia treated
              with antipsychotics participated in this open-label, 24-week
              switching study. The primary outcome measures were the Subjective
              Well-Being under Neuroleptic Treatment Scale-short version
              (SWN-K) and the Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI). The Krawiecka
              scale, Clinical Global Impression-Schizophrenia (CGI-SCH),
              Personal and Social Performance scale (PSP) were used to evaluate
              psychopathology and psychosocial functioning, respectively.
              RESULTS: Data from a total of 243 subjects who received the study
              medication and had at least one follow-up assessment without a
              major protocol violation were analyzed. Scores on the DAI and
              SWN-K showed significant improvement between baseline and
              end-point measurements beginning during the second week. Scores
              on the Krawiecka scale, all five subscales of the CGI-SCH scale,
              and the PSP scale were also significantly improved at the end
              point compared with the baseline. Significant predictors of
              improvements in the SWN-K and DAI after a switch to paliperidone
              ER were baseline scores, reductions in scores on the Krawiecka
              scale, and previous risperidone use. A clinically relevant
              increase in body weight ($\geq$7\% weight gain) occurred in
              one-fourth of the participants who completed the 24-week study.
              CONCLUSION: Switching to paliperidone ER improved the subjective
              well-being and attitudes towards antipsychotic medication in
              patients with schizophrenia. Exploratory analyses revealed that
              these improvements were particularly pronounced in patients who

  abstract = "Background: The therapeutic relationship and its importance for
              psychotherapy outcome have been the subject of extensive research
              over the last decades. An acute psychiatric inpatient setting is
              a unique environment where severely ill patients receive
              intensive treatment over a limited, relatively short, period of
              time. This renders establishing a good therapeutic relationship
              difficult for various reasons. It seems likely, however, that the
              therapeutic relationship in such a setting plays a vital role on
              factors such as clinical outcome, patient satisfaction, and
              rehospitalization rates. Little information is available on
              special attributes and caveats of building and maintaining a good
              therapeutic relationship in an acute psychiatric setting, neither
              on its influence on therapy success. Methods: An extensive
              systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, science
              direct, psyc info, and google scholar databases. Keywords used
              were therapeutic alliance, therapeutic relationship, psychiatry,
              emergency, acute, coercion, autonomy, involuntary, closed ward.
              RCTs, observational studies, reviews, meta-analyses, and economic
              evaluations were included, case reports and opinion papers were
              excluded. Factors specific to an acute psychiatric setting were
              identified, and the available information was categorized and
              analyzed accordingly. The PRISMA statement guidelines were
              followed closely upon research and preparation of the present
              review. Results: A total of 48 studies were selected based on
              their relevance as well as design. They demonstrated that several
              factors related to setting, patient attributes, staff attributes,
              admission circumstances, and general situation, render building
              and maintaining a good therapeutic relationship difficult in an
              acute psychiatric setting compared to scheduled, long-term
              therapeutic sessions. The available literature on how to overcome
              this dilemma is scarce. Interventions involving staff and/or
              patients have been shown to be effective in terms of relevant
              outcome parameters. Conclusions: Increasing research efforts, as
              well as raising awareness and providing specific competencies
              amongst clinicians and patients in terms of nurturing a good
              therapeutic relationship in acute settings, are necessary to
              improve clinical outcome, economic factors, quality of patient
              care and patient as well as staff satisfaction.",

              F25 in hospital or physician files, over a 12-year period

              RESULTS: In the last six months of life, compared to their
              matched cohort: decedents with schizophrenia had higher rates
              (52.1\% vs. 24.4\%, p<.00001) and number of days (89.2 vs.

              rates but no other disadvantages compared with maintenance
              treatment; however, long-term effects on recovery have not been
              studied before. OBJECTIVE: To compare rates of recovery in
              patients with remitted FEP after 7 years of follow-up of a dose
              reduction/discontinuation (DR) vs maintenance treatment (MT)
              trial. DESIGN: Seven-year follow-up of a 2-year open randomized
              clinical trial comparing MT and DR. SETTING: One hundred
              twenty-eight patients participating in the original trial were
              recruited from 257 patients with FEP referred from October 2001
              to December 2002 to 7 mental health care services in a 3.2
              million-population catchment area. Of these, 111 patients refused
              to participate and 18 patients did not experience remission.
              PARTICIPANTS After 7 years, 103 patients (80.5\%) of 128 patients
              who were included in the original trial were located and
              consented to follow-up assessment. INTERVENTION: After 6 months
              of remission, patients were randomly assigned to DR strategy or
              MT for 18 months. After the trial, treatment was at the
              discretion of the clinician. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary
              outcome was rate of recovery, defined as meeting the criteria of
              symptomatic and functional remission. Determinants of recovery
              were examined using logistic regression analysis; the treatment
              strategy (MT or DR) was controlled for baseline parameters.
              RESULTS: The DR patients experienced twice the recovery rate of
              the MT patients (40.4\% vs 17.6\%). Logistic regression showed an
              odds ratio of 3.49 (P = .01). Better DR recovery rates were
              related to higher functional remission rates in the DR group but
              were not related to symptomatic remission rates. CONCLUSIONS AND
              RELEVANCE: Dose reduction/discontinuation of antipsychotics
              during the early stages of remitted FEP shows superior long-term
              recovery rates compared with the rates achieved with MT. To our
              knowledge, this is the first study showing long-term gains of an
              early-course DR strategy in patients with remitted FEP.

              prevalence rates of SP remain high in schizophrenia (30\%) and

              co-occurring movement disorders more precisely. Detection of
              mild/borderline drug-induced movement disorders permits early
              recognition of overblockade of D2 receptors, responsible for SP
              and TD. Finally, we describe 3 antipsychotic withdrawal
              syndromes, similar to those seen with other CNS drugs, and we
              propose approaches to treat, potentially prevent, or temporarily

              safest medical products we use. Millions of vaccinations are
              given to children and adults in the United States each year.
              Serious adverse reactions are rare. However, because of the high
              volume of use, coincidental adverse events including deaths, that
              are temporally associated with vaccination, do occur. When death
              occurs shortly following vaccination, loved ones and others might
              naturally question whether it was related to vaccination. A large
              body of evidence supports the safety of vaccines, and multiple
              studies and scientific reviews have found no association between
              vaccination and deaths except in rare cases. During the US
              multi-state measles outbreak of 2014-2015, unsubstantiated claims
              of deaths caused by measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine
              began circulating on the Internet, prompting responses by public
              health officials to address common misinterpretations and misuses
              of vaccine safety surveillance data, particularly around
              spontaneous reports submitted to the US Vaccine Adverse Event
              Reporting System (VAERS). We summarize epidemiologic data on
              deaths following vaccination, including examples where reasonable
              scientific evidence exists to support that vaccination caused or
              contributed to deaths. Rare cases where a known or plausible
              theoretical risk of death following vaccination exists include
              anaphylaxis, vaccine-strain systemic infection after
              administration of live vaccines to severely immunocompromised

              electroencephalography (EEG), a tool more easily implemented in
              clinical practice. Objective: To determine whether EEG
              connectivity could reveal neural moderators of antidepressant
              treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this
              nonprespecified secondary analysis, data were analyzed from the
              Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant
              Response in Clinic Care study, a placebo-controlled,
              double-blinded randomized clinical trial. Recruitment began July
              29, 2011, and was completed December 15, 2015. A random sample of
              221 outpatients with depression aged 18 to 65 years who were not
              taking medication for depression was recruited and assessed at 4
              clinical sites. Analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat
              basis. Statistical analysis was performed from November 16, 2018,
              to May 23, 2019. Interventions: Patients received either the
              selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline hydrochloride
              or placebo for 8 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures:
              Electroencephalographic orthogonalized power envelope
              connectivity analyses were applied to resting-state EEG data.
              Intent-to-treat prediction linear mixed models were used to
              determine which pretreatment connectivity patterns were
              associated with response to sertraline vs placebo. The primary
              clinical outcome was the total score on the 17-item Hamilton
              Rating Scale for Depression, administered at each study visit.
              Results: Of the participants recruited, 9 withdrew after first
              dose owing to reported adverse effects, and 221 participants (150
              women; mean [SD] age, 37.8 [12.7] years) underwent EEG recordings
              and had high-quality pretreatment EEG data. After correction for
              multiple comparisons, connectome-wide analyses revealed
              moderation by connections within and between widespread cortical
              regions-most prominently parietal-for both the antidepressant and
              placebo groups. Greater alpha-band and lower gamma-band
              connectivity predicted better placebo outcomes and worse
              antidepressant outcomes. Lower connectivity levels in these
              moderating connections were associated with higher levels of
              anhedonia. Connectivity features that moderate treatment response
              differentially by treatment group were distinct from connectivity
              features that change from baseline to 1 week into treatment. The
              group mean (SD) score on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for
              Depression was 18.35 (4.58) at baseline and 26.14 (30.37) across
              all time points. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings
              establish the utility of EEG-based network functional
              connectivity analyses for differentiating between responses to an
              antidepressant vs placebo. A role emerged for parietal cortical
              regions in predicting placebo outcome. From a treatment
              perspective, capitalizing on the therapeutic components leading
              to placebo response differentially from antidepressant response
              should provide an alternative direction toward establishing a
              placebo signature in clinical trials, thereby enhancing the
              signal detection in randomized clinical trials. Trial

              natural and social sciences, psychiatric objects of inquiry,
              namely mental symptoms and mental disorders, are hybrid,
              constituted by the blending of components arising from disparate

              two aspects of the impact of their work. First, from the
              viewpoint of those interested in the relation of brain to
              behaviour, I recount why their initial experiments produced such
              an immediate impact. Hubel and Wiesel's work appeared against a
              background of substantial behavioural knowledge about visual
              perception, a growing desire to know the underlying brain
              mechanisms for this perception, and an abysmal lack of
              physiological information about the neurons in visual cortex that
              might underlie these mechanisms. Their initial results showed
              both the transformations that occur from one level of processing
              to the next and how a sequence of these transformations might
              lead to at least the elements of pattern perception. Their
              experiments immediately provided a structure for conceptualizing
              how cortical neurons could be organized to produce perception. A
              second impact of Hubel and Wiesel's work has been the multiple
              paths of research they blazed. I comment here on just one of
              these paths, the analysis of visual cortex in the monkey,
              particularly in the awake monkey. This direction has led to an
              explosion in the number of investigations of cortical areas
              beyond striate cortex and has addressed more complex behavioural
              questions, but it has evolved from the approach to neuronal

              In 1891, Paul Ehrlich observed the antimalarial effects of
              methylene blue, a phenothiazine derivative. Later, the
              phenothiazines were developed for their antihistaminergic
              properties. In 1951, Laborit and Huguenard administered the

              potential anesthetic effects during surgery. Shortly thereafter,
              Hamon et al. and Delay et al. extended the use of this treatment
              in psychiatric patients and serendipitously uncovered its
              antipsychotic activity. Between 1954 and 1975, about 15
              antipsychotic drugs were introduced in the United States and
              about 40 throughout the world. Thereafter, there was a hiatus in
              the development of antipsychotics until the introduction of
              clozapine treatment in the United States in 1990 opened the era
              of ``atypical'' antipsychotic drugs, which show a reduced
              potential to induce extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), an increased
              efficacy for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, no elevation
              of prolactin after chronic use (except risperidone), and, at
              least for clozapine, effectiveness in some patients previously
              regarded as treatment-refractory. This review describes the
              available atypical antipsychotic drugs and their characteristics,
              and concludes by highlighting those in the pharmaceutical

              mechanisms underlying their complex origins remain to be
              elucidated. Dysfunction of critical intracellular signaling
              pathways is very likely to be involved. This conclusion is based
              on a number of observations, including the short- and long-term
              cellular effects of psychiatric drugs; the critical role
              signaling pathways play in neurotransmitter, neuropeptide, and

              historical development and the current state of the art. METHOD:
              This paper is based on extensive but selective literature review
              and also draws on our extensive clinical and research
              experiences. RESULTS: Although the construct of neuroleptic
              dysphoria was recognized shortly following the introduction of
              the first antipsychotic, chlorpromazine, it took several years
              for the concept to receive adequate research and clinical
              attention. Without having direct evidence to link neuroleptic
              dysphoria to dopamine, it was generally understood that dopamine
              played a significant role in its genesis. In recent neuroimaging
              studies and dopamine depletion strategies, the role of dopamine
              in the genesis of neuroleptic dysphoria has been directly
              confirmed. CONCLUSION: Neuroleptic dysphoria is a valid
              construct, which has significant implications for treatment and
              outcome. It is now clear that it relates to dopamine activities
              in the nigrostriatal complex. Recent research has also raised the
              issue of whether neuroleptic dysphoria is a variant of
              extrapyramidal symptoms. Meanwhile, the role of dopamine in both

              raised the issue of both conditions being different facets of the

              establish predictors for never being treated. METHOD: All
              participants with schizophrenia (n = 510) in Xinjin, Chengdu,
              China were identified in an epidemiological investigation of 123
              572 people and followed up from 1994 to 2008. RESULTS: The
              results showed that there were 30.6\%, 25.0\% and 20.4\% of
              patients who received no antipsychotic medication in 1994, 2004
              and 2008 respectively. Compared with treated patients, those who
              were never treated in 2008 were significantly older, had
              significantly fewer family members, had higher rates of
              homelessness, death from other causes, being unmarried, living
              alone, being without a caregiver and poor family attitudes.
              Partial and complete remission in treated patients (57.3\%) was
              significantly higher than that in the never-treated group
              (29.8\%). Predictors of being in the never-treated group in 2008
              encompassed baseline never-treated status, being without a
              caregiver and poor mental health status in 1994. CONCLUSIONS:
              Many patients with schizophrenia still do not receive
              antipsychotic medication in rural areas of China. The 14-year
              follow-up showed that outcomes for the untreated group were

              and functional outcome and, to a less clear extent, to a better
              quality of life and cognitive performance. However, achieving
              symptomatic remission is not automatically concurrent with an
              adequate status in other outcome dimensions. The results of the
              present review suggest that the RSWG remission criteria are valid
              and useful. As such, they should be consistently applied in
              clinical trials. However the lack of consensus definitions of
              functional remission and adequate quality of life hampers
              research on their predictive validity on these outcome
              dimensions. Future research should therefore search for criteria
              of these dimensions and test whether the RSWG remission criteria
              consistently predict a ``good'' outcome with respect to
              functioning and quality of life.",

              adulthood, with considerable associated distress and functional
              decline appearing during this critical developmental phase. Our
              current diagnostic system lacks therapeutic validity,
              particularly for the early stages of mental disorders when
              symptoms are still emerging and intensifying and have not yet
              stabilized sufficiently to fit the existing syndromal criteria.
              While this is, in part, due to the difficulty of distinguishing
              transient developmental or normative changes from the early
              symptoms of persistent and disabling mental illness, these
              factors have contributed to a growing movement for the reform of
              our current diagnostic system to more adequately inform the
              choice of therapeutic strategy, particularly in the early stages
              of a mental illness. The clinical staging model, which defines
              not only the extent of progression of a disorder at a particular
              point in time but also where a person lies currently along the
              continuum of the course of an illness, is particularly useful as
              it differentiates early, milder clinical phenomena from those
              that accompany illness progression and chronicity. This will not
              only enable clinicians to select treatments relevant to earlier
              stages of an illness, where such interventions are likely to be
              more effective and less harmful than treatments delivered later
              in the course of illness, but also allow a more efficient
              integration of our rapidly expanding knowledge of the biological,

              of prevalence of AEs in trial placebo groups across different
              conditions. (2) To compare AEs in trial placebo groups with AEs
              reported in untreated groups within a subset of randomized
              trials. SEARCH METHODS: We searched PubMed for records with the
              word ``nocebo'' in the title and ``systematic'' in any field. We
              also contacted experts and hand-searched references of included
              studies. STUDY ELIGIBILITY: We included any systematic review of
              randomized trials where nocebo effects were reported. We excluded
              systematic reviews of non-randomized studies. PARTICIPANTS AND
              INTERVENTIONS: We included studies in any disease area. STUDY
              APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: We appraised the quality of the
              studies using a shortened version of the Assessment of Multiple
              Systematic Reviews tool (AMSTAR) tool. We reported medians and
              interquartile ranges (IQRs) of AEs. Among the trials within the
              review that included untreated groups, we compared the prevalence
              of AEs in untreated groups with the prevalence of AEs in placebo
              groups. RESULTS: We identified 20 systematic reviews. These
              included 1271 randomized trials and 250,726 placebo-treated
              patients. The median prevalence of AEs in trial placebo groups
              was 49.1\% (IQR 25.7-64.4\%). The median rate of dropouts due to
              AEs was 5\% (IQR 2.28-8.4\%). Within the 15 of trials that
              reported AEs in untreated groups, we found that the AE rate in
              placebo groups (6.51\%) was higher than that reported in
              untreated groups (4.25\%). LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by
              the quality of included reviews and the small number of trials
              that included untreated groups. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF
              KEY FINDINGS: AEs in trial placebo groups are common and cannot
              be attributed entirely to natural history. Trial methodologies

              non-delusional schizophrenia patients and healthy participants to
              assign affective meanings to neutral stimuli. METHODS:
              Unpleasant, pleasant, and neutral words were randomly presented
              to three subject groups--patients with schizophrenia with
              prominent delusions, patients with schizophrenia without
              delusions, and healthy participants. Participants performed three
              tasks: one in which they decided whether a letter string was a
              word or a non-word (lexical decision) and two affective
              classification tasks in which they judged whether words were 1)
              neutral or unpleasant, or 2) neutral or pleasant. RESULTS: While
              there were no significant between-group differences in lexical
              decision performance, patients with delusions showed selective
              performance deficits in both affective classification tasks.
              First, delusional patients were significantly more likely than
              non-delusional patients and healthy participants to classify
              words as unpleasant. Second, delusional patients took
              significantly longer than both other groups to correctly classify
              neutral words in both affective classification tasks.
              CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings suggest that

              TR is associated with adherence to antipsychotics in patients
              with schizophrenia. METHODS: 134 clinicians and 507 of their
              patients with schizophrenia or a related psychotic disorder
              participated in a European multi-centre study. A logistic
              regression model examined how the TR as rated by patients and by
              clinicians is associated with medication adherence, adjusting for
              clinician clustering and symptom severity. RESULTS: Patient and
              clinician ratings of the TR were weakly inter-correlated (r(s) =
              0.13, p = 0.004), but each was independently linked with better
              adherence. After adjusting for patient rated TR and symptom
              severity, each unit increase in clinician rated TR was associated
              with an increase of the odds ratio of good compliance by 65.9\%

              associated with better adherence to medication among patients

              brain scans were obtained from all subjects with a 1-year

              antipsychotic medication (olanzapine, risperidone, or quetiapine)
              or did not (n = 8) discontinue during the follow-up period.
              Intracranial volume and volumes of total brain, cerebral gray and

              in psychiatric curricula. RECENT FINDINGS: 2013 is the centennial
              of the first edition of Karl Jaspers' General Psychopathology.
              Several books and articles published during this year discuss the
              role of psychopathology for psychiatrists. SUMMARY: Psychiatrists
              need personal formation or cultivation alongside a thorough
              scientific education - restrictively understood as acquisition of
              technical knowledge and skill training. Psychopathology provides
              both educational resources (e.g., valid and reliable concepts and
              methods for establishing accurate diagnosis) and that kind of
              sensitivity, namely the sensitivity to what is appropriate in
              dealing with others, for which knowledge from general principles
              does not suffice. Tact, as the ability to feel an atmosphere and
              to attune with it in those situations that are not yet plainly
              and unambiguously defined, is an example of this. When
              evidence-based guidelines are still scarce (as is the case, for
              instance, with early psychoses), tact seems to be an
              indispensable resource for the psychiatrist.",

              all-cause mortality, smoking, and age-associated proteins, yet
              multiple previous studies found no association between SZ and
              biological age using Horvath's epigenetic clock, a
              well-established aging biomarker based on DNA methylation.
              However, numerous epigenetic clocks that may capture distinct
              aspects of aging have been developed. This study tested the
              hypothesis that altered aging in SZ manifests in these other
              clocks. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive analysis of 14
              epigenetic clocks categorized according to what they were trained
              to predict: chronological age, mortality, mitotic divisions, or
              telomere length. To understand the etiology of biological age
              differences, we also examined DNA methylation predictors of
              smoking, alcohol, body mass index, serum proteins, and cell
              proportions. We independently analyzed 3 publicly available
              multiethnic DNA methylation data sets from whole blood, a total
              of 567 SZ cases and 594 nonpsychiatric controls. RESULTS: All
              data sets showed accelerations in SZ for the 3 mortality clocks
              up to 5 years, driven by smoking and elevated levels of 6
              age-associated proteins. The 2 mitotic clocks were decelerated in
              SZ related to antitumor natural killer and CD8T cells, which may
              help explain conflicting reports about low cancer rates in
              epidemiological studies of SZ. One cohort with available
              medication data showed that clozapine is associated with
              male-specific decelerations up to 7 years in multiple
              chronological age clocks. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the
              utility of studying the various epigenetic clocks in tandem and
              highlights potential mechanisms by which mental illness
              influences long-term outcomes, including cancer and early

              mortality in people with schizophrenia is higher than that in the
              general population but have used relative measures, such as
              standardised mortality ratios. We did a systematic review and
              meta-analysis to estimate years of potential life lost and life
              expectancy in schizophrenia, which are more direct, absolute
              measures of increased mortality. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE,
              PsycINFO, Embase, Cinahl, and Web of Science for published
              studies on years of potential life lost and life expectancy in
              schizophrenia. Data from individual studies were combined in
              meta-analyses as weighted averages. We did subgroup analyses for
              sex, geographical region, timing of publication, and risk of bias
              (estimated with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale). FINDINGS: We
              identified 11 studies in 13 publications covering all inhabited
              continents except South America (Africa n=1, Asia n=1, Australia
              n=1, Europe n=7, and North America n=3) that involved up to 247
              603 patients. Schizophrenia was associated with a weighted
              average of 14·5 years of potential life lost (95\% CI 11·2-17·8),
              and was higher for men than women (15·9, 13·8-18·0 vs 13·6,
              11·4-15·8). Loss was least in the Asian study and greatest in
              Africa. The overall weighted average life expectancy was 64·7
              years (95\% CI 61·1-71·3), and was lower for men than women (59·9
              years, 95\% CI 55·5-64·3 vs 67·6 years, 63·1-72·1). Life
              expectancy was lowest in Asia and Africa. Timing of publication
              and risk of bias had little effect on results. INTERPRETATION:
              The effects of schizophrenia on years potential life lost and
              life expectancy seem to be substantial and not to have lessened
              over time. Development and implementation of interventions and

              hallucinators in comparison with episodic hallucinators. SAMPLING
              AND METHODS: Ninety-one outpatients with AH were assessed through
              semistructured interviews. The interviews included the Psychotic
              Symptom Rating Scales for AH and the Krawiecka scale. They
              elicited descriptions about the persistence of AH, existence of
              pleasurable hallucinations and other types of hallucinations.
              RESULTS: Forty-five patients fulfilled criteria for reported PAH.
              Persistent hallucinators showed greater scores in frequency and
              duration of hallucinations, Krawiecka total score and incoherence
              of speech. Moreover, pleasurable experiences were more frequent
              in this group of patients. Logistic regression analysis rendered
              a model with the following variables: duration of voices, degree
              of control and pleasurable hallucinations. CONCLUSION: Specific
              dimensions of AH can predict the possibility of treatment
              resistance.",

              effectiveness of common medical drugs. AIMS: To put the efficacy
              of psychiatric drugs into the perspective of that of major
              medical drugs. METHOD: We searched Medline and the Cochrane
              Library for systematic reviews on the efficacy of drugs compared
              with placebo for common medical and psychiatric disorders, and
              systematically presented the effect sizes for primary efficacy
              outcomes. RESULTS: We included 94 meta-analyses (48 drugs in 20
              medical diseases, 16 drugs in 8 psychiatric disorders). There
              were some general medical drugs with clearly higher effect sizes
              than the psychotropic agents, but the psychiatric drugs were not
              generally less efficacious than other drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Any
              comparison of different outcomes in different diseases can only
              serve the purpose of a qualitative perspective. The increment of
              improvement by drug over placebo must be viewed in the context of

              (b) to examine if recovery was associated with factors such as

              the study. We also examined if the proportions who met our
              definition of recovery had changed over time. METHOD: A
              comprehensive search strategy was used to identify potential
              studies, and data were extracted for those that met inclusion
              criteria. The proportion who met our recovery criteria
              (improvements in both clinical and social domains and evidence
              that improvements in at least 1 of these 2 domains had persisted
              for at least 2 years) was extracted from each study.
              Meta-regression techniques were used to explore the association
              between the recovery proportions and the selected variables.
              RESULTS: We identified 50 studies with data suitable for
              inclusion. The median proportion (25\%-75\% quantiles) who met
              our recovery criteria was 13.5\% (8.1\%-20.0\%). Studies from
              sites in countries with poorer economic status had higher

              proposed that suggest the emergence of paradigm shifts in this
              area. In particular, quantum theories of mind, brain and
              consciousness seem to offer a profound change to the current
              approaches. Unfortunately these quantum paradigms harbor at least
              two serious problems. First, they are simply models, theories,
              and assumptions, with no convincing experiments supporting their
              claims. Second, they deviate from contemporary mainstream views
              of psychiatric illness and do so in revolutionary ways. We
              suggest a possible way to integrate experimental neuroscience
              with quantum models in order to address outstanding issues in
              psychopathology. A key role is played by the phenomenon called
              the ``stream of consciousness'', which can be linked to the
              so-called ``Gamma Synchrony'' (GS), which is clearly demonstrated
              by EEG data. In our novel proposal, a unipolar depressed patient
              could be seen as a subject with an altered stream of
              consciousness. In particular, some clues suggest that depression
              is linked to an ``increased power'' stream of consciousness. It
              is additionally suggested that such an approach to depression
              might be extended to psychopathology in general with potential

              events (AEs) for the drug under evaluation to treat
              schizophrenia. Interestingly, patients who receive the placebo
              during antipsychotic trials often report several AEs, but little
              is known about the essence of these negative effects in patients
              with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SCD). In the present
              meta-analysis, we evaluated the relationship between the level of
              psychiatric symptomatology expressed as Positive and Negative
              Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores and the rates of AEs reported in
              the placebo arms of double-blind clinical trials, for commonly
              prescribed atypical antipsychotic medications. Methods: We
              selected 58 clinical trials describing AEs in SCD placebo groups,
              which compared atypical antipsychotic medications with placebo. A
              total of 6,301 placebo-treated patients were considered. AE
              profiles of the class were clusterized using MedDRA
              classification and analysed using a meta-regression approach.
              Results: In the placebo arms the proportions of patients with any
              AE was 66.3\% (95\% CI: 62.7-69.8\%). The proportion of
              withdrawal of patients treated with placebo because of AEs was
              7.2\% (95\% CI: 5.9-8.4\%). Interestingly, the AEs in the placebo
              arms corresponded to those of the
              antipsychotic-atypical-medication-class against which the placebo
              was compared. Namely, using meta-regression analysis we found an
              association between the level of psychiatric symptomatology
              measured with PANSS scores and higher AEs reported as nervous
              system (p = 0.020) and gastrintestinal disorders (p = 0.004).
              Moreover, the level of a higher psychiatric symptomatology
              expressed with PANSS scores was also related with higher AEs
              associated with psychiatric symptoms (p = 0.017). Conclusion:
              These findings emphasise that the AEs in placebo arms of clinical
              trials of antipsychotic medications were substantial.
              Importantly, a higher level of psychiatric symptomatology makes
              SCD patients more prone to express AEs, thus contributing to
              possible drop-outs and to a lower adherence to treatments. These
              results are consistent with the expectation theory of placebo and

  abstract = "Importance: In recent years, there has been increased focus on
              subthreshold stages of mental disorders, with attempts to model
              and predict which individuals will progress to full-threshold
              disorder. Given this research attention and the clinical
              significance of the issue, this article analyzes the assumptions
              of the theoretical models in the field. Observations: Psychiatric
              research into predicting the onset of mental disorder has shown
              an overreliance on one-off sampling of cross-sectional data (ie,
              a snapshot of clinical state and other risk markers) and may
              benefit from taking dynamic changes into account in predictive
              modeling. Cross-disciplinary approaches to complex system
              structures and changes, such as dynamical systems theory, network
              theory, instability mechanisms, chaos theory, and catastrophe
              theory, offer potent models that can be applied to the emergence
              (or decline) of psychopathology, including psychosis prediction,
              as well as to transdiagnostic emergence of symptoms. Conclusions
              and Relevance: Psychiatric research may benefit from approaching
              psychopathology as a system rather than as a category,
              identifying dynamics of system change (eg, abrupt vs gradual
              psychosis onset), and determining the factors to which these
              systems are most sensitive (eg, interpersonal dynamics and
              neurochemical change) and the individual variability in system
              architecture and change. These goals can be advanced by testing
              hypotheses that emerge from cross-disciplinary models of complex
              systems. Future studies require repeated longitudinal assessment
              of relevant variables through either (or a combination of)
              micro-level (momentary and day-to-day) and macro-level (month and
              year) assessments. Ecological momentary assessment is a data
              collection technique appropriate for micro-level assessment.
              Relevant statistical approaches are joint modeling and time
              series analysis, including metric-based and model-based methods
              that draw on the mathematical principles of dynamical systems.
              This next generation of prediction studies may more accurately
              model the dynamic nature of psychopathology and system change as
              well as have treatment implications, such as introducing a means
              of identifying critical periods of risk for mental state

              medication might adversely affect long-term outcomes for people
              with schizophrenia. The evidence cited for these concerns
              includes the association of antipsychotic treatment with brain
              volume reduction and with dopamine receptor sensitization, which
              might make patients vulnerable to relapse and illness
              progression. An international group of experts was convened to
              examine findings from clinical and basic research relevant to
              these concerns. Little evidence was found to support a negative
              long-term effect of initial or maintenance antipsychotic
              treatment on outcomes, compared with withholding treatment.
              Randomized controlled trials strongly support the efficacy of
              antipsychotics for the acute treatment of psychosis and
              prevention of relapse; correlational evidence suggests that early
              intervention and reduced duration of untreated psychosis might
              improve longer-term outcomes. Strategies for treatment
              discontinuation or alternative nonpharmacologic treatment

              in most patients with schizophrenia, yet the nature of these
              episodes has not been extensively researched and clinicians may
              not always be aware of important implications. METHODS: We
              critically review selected literature regarding the nature and
              underlying neurobiology of relapse. RESULTS: Relapse rates are
              very high when treatment is discontinued, even after a single
              psychotic episode; a longer treatment period prior to
              discontinuation does not reduce the risk of relapse; many
              patients relapse soon after treatment reduction and
              discontinuation; transition from remission to relapse may be
              abrupt and with few or no early warning signs; once illness
              recurrence occurs symptoms rapidly return to levels similar to
              the initial psychotic episode; while most patients respond
              promptly to re-introduction of antipsychotic treatment after
              relapse, the response time is variable and notably, treatment
              failure appears to emerge in about 1 in 6 patients. These
              observations are consistent with contemporary thinking on the
              dopamine hypothesis, including the aberrant salience hypothesis.
              CONCLUSIONS: Given the difficulties in identifying those at risk
              of relapse, the ineffectiveness of rescue medications in
              preventing full-blown psychotic recurrence and the potentially
              serious consequences, adherence and other factors predisposing to
              relapse should be a major focus of attention in managing
              schizophrenia. The place of antipsychotic treatment

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Scarce studies analyzing adverse event (AE) data from
              randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (RPCCTs) of
              selected illnesses suggested that a substantial proportion of
              collected AEs are unrelated to the drug taken. This study
              analyzed the nonspecific AEs occurring with active-drug exposure
              in RPCCTs for a large range of medical conditions. METHODS:
              Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials published in five
              prominent medical journals during 2006-2012 were searched. Only
              trials that evaluated orally or parenterally administered active
              drugs versus placebo in a head-to-head setting were selected. For
              AEs reported from $\geq$10 RPCCTs, Pearson's correlation
              coefficients (r) were calculated to determine the relationship
              between AE rates in placebo and active-drug recipients.
              Random-effects meta-analyses were used to compute proportions of
              nonspecific AEs, which were truncated at a maximum of 100\%, in
              active-drug recipients. RESULTS: We included 231 trials
              addressing various medical domains or healthy participants. For
              the 88 analyzed AE variables, AE rates for placebo and
              active-drug recipients were in general strongly correlated (r >
              0.50) or very strongly correlated (r > 0.80). The pooled
              proportions of nonspecific AEs for the active-drug recipients
              were 96.8\% (95\%CI: 95.5-98.1) for any AEs, 100\% (97.9-100) for
              serious AEs, and 77.7\% (72.7-83.2) for drug-related AEs. Results
              were similar for individual medical domains and healthy
              participants. The pooled proportion of nonspecificity of 82
              system organ class and individual AE types ranged from 38\% to
              100\%. CONCLUSION: The large proportion of nonspecific AEs
              reported in active-drug recipients of RPCCTs, including serious
              and drug-related AEs, highlights the limitations of clinical
              trial data to determine the tolerability of drugs. Copyright

              an identified factor for relapse and hospitalizations with major
              social and economic consequences. Various determinants of poor

              role of therapeutic alliance on medication adherence in routine
              mental healthcare. AIMS: To investigate links between therapeutic
              alliance insight and medication adherence in routine care and
              community psychiatry. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 38
              inpatients that met ICD-10 criteria for schizophrenia or
              schizoaffective disorder were recruited and independently
              interviewed just before discharge. Various rating scales were
              used: the self-reported 4-Point ordinal Alliance Scale (4PAS),
              the Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS) and the Scale to
              assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder (SUMD). In addition, we
              investigated the relationships between medication adherence and
              clinical variables through uni- and multivariate analysis.
              RESULTS: Therapeutic alliance was significantly correlated with
              adherence (r = 0.663, P < 0.0001) and insight (r =-0.664, P <
              0.0001). Poor adherence was associated in patients with substance
              or alcohol use disorders (5.4 vs. 2.9, P = 0.0075, t = 2.83). No
              significant difference was found between the demographic
              characteristics of the sample, the characteristics of the
              treatments and adherence. CONCLUSIONS: A weak therapeutic
              alliance and low insight are associated with poor adherence in
              patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were
              hospitalized. Specific psycho-educational programs to improve
              therapeutic alliance and insight should be implemented to achieve

  abstract = "CONTEXT: Progressive brain volume changes in schizophrenia are
              thought to be due principally to the disease. However, recent
              animal studies indicate that antipsychotics, the mainstay of
              treatment for schizophrenia patients, may also contribute to
              brain tissue volume decrement. Because antipsychotics are
              prescribed for long periods for schizophrenia patients and have
              increasingly widespread use in other psychiatric disorders, it is
              imperative to determine their long-term effects on the human
              brain. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate relative contributions of 4
              potential predictors (illness duration, antipsychotic treatment,
              illness severity, and substance abuse) of brain volume change.
              DESIGN: Predictors of brain volume changes were assessed
              prospectively based on multiple informants. SETTING: Data from
              the Iowa Longitudinal Study. PATIENTS: Two hundred eleven
              patients with schizophrenia who underwent repeated neuroimaging
              beginning soon after illness onset, yielding a total of 674
              high-resolution magnetic resonance scans. On average, each
              patient had 3 scans ($\geq$2 and as many as 5) over 7.2 years (up
              to 14 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Brain volumes. RESULTS:
              During longitudinal follow-up, antipsychotic treatment reflected
              national prescribing practices in 1991 through 2009. Longer
              follow-up correlated with smaller brain tissue volumes and larger
              cerebrospinal fluid volumes. Greater intensity of antipsychotic
              treatment was associated with indicators of generalized and
              specific brain tissue reduction after controlling for effects of
              the other 3 predictors. More antipsychotic treatment was
              associated with smaller gray matter volumes. Progressive
              decrement in white matter volume was most evident among patients
              who received more antipsychotic treatment. Illness severity had
              relatively modest correlations with tissue volume reduction, and
              alcohol/illicit drug misuse had no significant associations when
              effects of the other variables were adjusted. CONCLUSIONS: Viewed
              together with data from animal studies, our study suggests that
              antipsychotics have a subtle but measurable influence on brain
              tissue loss over time, suggesting the importance of careful
              risk-benefit review of dosage and duration of treatment as well
              as their off-label use.",

              to placebo response in randomized controlled trials of

              extracted trial design and clinical variables from eligible
              randomized controlled trials (N=50) identified through searches
              of MEDLINE (1960-2010) and other sources. Standardized mean
              change (SMC) was used as the effect size measure for placebo
              response, based on change scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating
              Scale or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale from baseline
              to endpoint (2 to 12 weeks). RESULTS: The results suggest
              significant heterogeneities (Q=387.83, df=49) in the magnitude of
              placebo response (mean SMC, -0.33, range -1.4 to 0.9) and in
              study quality. Both placebo SMC and study quality increased over
              time. Younger age, shorter duration of illness, greater baseline
              symptom severity, and shorter trial duration were significantly
              associated with greater placebo response, while country (United
              States compared with other countries) was not. More study sites,
              fewer university or Veterans Affairs treatment settings, and a
              lower percentage of patients assigned to receive placebo were
              associated with a greater placebo response, but these were not
              independent of publication year. Study quality affected the
              variability but not mean levels of placebo response. CONCLUSIONS:
              This study identified important patient characteristics and trial

               the basic pathological features of schizophrenia in general.
               This assumption, we believe, is consistent with the traditional
               thrust of phenomenological-anthropological psychopathology: the
               main mental disorders manifest a particular kind of human
               being-in-the-world. The component parts of the disorder, then,
               must be theoretically situated within the general context of
               this mode of being-in-the-world. Only within this basic
               anthropological context can it become intelligible how the
               experiencing subject construes and deals with itself and with
               its experienced world.",

              The diagnostic process is further confounded by the need to

  author   = "Borsboom, Denny",
  abstract = "In recent years, the network approach to psychopathology has been
              advanced as an alternative way of conceptualizing mental
              disorders. In this approach, mental disorders arise from direct
              interactions between symptoms. Although the network approach has
              led to many novel methodologies and substantive applications, it
              has not yet been fully articulated as a scientific theory of
              mental disorders. The present paper aims to develop such a
              theory, by postulating a limited set of theoretical principles
              regarding the structure and dynamics of symptom networks. At the
              heart of the theory lies the notion that symptoms of
              psychopathology are causally connected through myriads of
              biological, psychological and societal mechanisms. If these
              causal relations are sufficiently strong, symptoms can generate a
              level of feedback that renders them self-sustaining. In this
              case, the network can get stuck in a disorder state. The network
              theory holds that this is a general feature of mental disorders,
              which can therefore be understood as alternative stable states of
              strongly connected symptom networks. This idea naturally leads to
              a comprehensive model of psychopathology, encompassing a common
              explanatory model for mental disorders, as well as novel
              definitions of associated concepts such as mental health,
              resilience, vulnerability and liability. In addition, the network
              theory has direct implications for how to understand diagnosis
              and treatment, and suggests a clear agenda for future research in
              psychiatry and associated disciplines.",

              connectivity in established schizophrenia, however, it is unclear
              when these abnormalities occur during the course of illness and
              if they are progressive. Here we investigated whether WM
              abnormalities predate illness onset by examining a group of
              individuals with an 'at risk mental state' (ARMS) and assess
              whether there is evidence of progressive change. We hypothesized
              that WM abnormalities are associated with symptom change.
              METHODS: Sixteen healthy controls and 41 ARMS subjects at
              baseline underwent Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). Sub-threshold
              positive symptoms were measured using the Scale of Prodromal
              Symptoms (SOPS). Imaging and symptoms were re-administered in the
              ARMS group after one year (52weeks). Fractional anisotropy (FA)
              value differences between ARMS and control groups at baseline
              were localized using the method of Tract-Based Spatial Statistics
              (TBSS). RESULTS: At baseline, FA was significantly reduced in a
              sub-region of the corpus callosum (CC) in the ARMS group as a
              whole compared to controls. This reduction was also found in the
              34 individuals who did not transition (ARMS-N) during the
              one-year follow-up. However, the ARMS-N group showed a
              significant improvement in sub-threshold positive symptoms at
              follow-up, which was correlated with an increase in FA in the
              same CC region (r=-0.664, p<0.001). DISCUSSION: There was a
              significant FA reduction in the CC in individuals at high risk
              for psychosis regardless of transition status at one year. This
              suggests that WM abnormalities in the CC may represent a
              biological vulnerability to psychosis. Improvement in
              sub-threshold positive symptoms was associated with improvement
              in measures of WM integrity in the CC. This may suggest that
              neurobiological 'resilience' is associated with improved
              outcomes, although this notion requires future study.",

@ARTICLE{Picardi2019-gd,
  title    = "The Two Faces of {First-Rank} Symptoms",
  author   = "Picardi, Angelo",
  abstract = "Recently, there has been renewed interest in Schneider's
              first-rank symptoms (FRS) of schizophrenia, thanks in part to a
              meta-analysis of their diagnostic accuracy, which deserves much
              credit for its methodological rigor. Conceptualising FRS as a
              diagnostic test whose performance can be measured in terms of
              sensitivity and specificity involves some issues that require
              reflection. First, the full adequacy of sensitivity as a measure
              of diagnostic accuracy for FRS might be questioned. However, it
              is conceptually acceptable, though FRS are at a disadvantage as
              compared with many other psychiatric ``diagnostic tests'' that
              should have perfect sensitivity under ideal conditions. Also,
              from a psychopathological perspective it may well be argued that
              FRS cannot be conceptualised as a simple, inexpensive diagnostic
              test suitable for screening purposes; however, the history of the
              concept reveals some reasons why it may be legitimate to view
              them this way. While no other relevant study has appeared after
              the publication of the meta-analysis, data on a further 166
              patients from a study that could not be included due to
              incompletely reported data were located. This brought the total
              to 4,236 patients from 17 studies on the ability of FRS to
              differentiate schizophrenia from other psychoses. The resulting
              summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity and positive and
              negative likelihood ratios are 60.2\%, 75.9\%, 2.50, and 0.52,
              respectively. FRS have a kind of double nature, as they can be
              legitimately considered as belonging to both a sophisticated
              framework grounded in phenomenological psychopathology and an
              eminently pragmatic framework grounded in clinical epidemiology.
              When FRS are conceptualised as simple clinical indicators that
              require low levels of inference, the available estimates of their
              diagnostic accuracy are a fairly valid appraisal of their
              performance and usefulness, and suggest that FRS have some value
              in differential diagnosis. However, when FRS are conceptualised
              as profoundly anomalous experiences that can be properly
              identified and evaluated only by using a phenomenological
              approach, these estimates can hardly be seen as a valid
              evaluation of their diagnostic significance. Phenomenologically
              informed studies are needed to address this research gap.",

               interest of the field of psychiatry and clinical psychology on
               the issue of nosology. This interest has been further heightened
               by a series of controversies associated with the development of
               DSM-5 including the fate of proposed revisions of the
               personality disorders, bereavement, and the autism spectrum.
               Major debate arose within the DSM process about the criteria for
               changing criteria, leading to the creation of first the
               Scientific Review Committee and then a series of other oversight
               committees which weighed in on the final debates on the most
               controversial proposed additions to DSM-5, providing important
               influences on the final decisions. Contained within these
               debates were a range of conceptual and philosophical issues.
               Some of these - such as the definition of mental disorder or the
               problems of psychiatric ``epidemics'' - have been with the field
               for a long time. Others - the concept of epistemic iteration as
               a framework for the introduction of nosologic change - are quite
               new. This book reviews issues within psychiatric nosology from
               clinical, historical and particularly philosophical
               perspectives. The book brings together a range of distinguished
               authors - including major psychiatric researchers, clinicians,
               historians and especially nosologists - including several
               leaders of the DSM-5 effort and the DSM Steering Committee. It
               also includes contributions from psychologists with a special
               interest in psychiatric nosology and philosophers with a wide
               range of orientations. The book is organized into four major
               sections: The first explores the nature of psychiatric illness
               and the way in which it is defined, including clinical and
               psychometric perspectives. The second section examines problems
               in the reification of psychiatric diagnostic criteria, the
               problem of psychiatric epidemics, and the nature and definition
               of individual symptoms. The third section explores the concept
               of epistemic iteration as a possible governing conceptual
               framework for the revision efforts for official psychiatric
               nosologies such as DSM and ICD and the problems of validation of
               psychiatric diagnoses.The book ends by exploring how we might
               move from the descriptive to the etiologic in psychiatric
               diagnoses, the nature of progress in psychiatric research, and
               the possible benefits of moving to a living document (or
               continuous improvement) model for psychiatric nosologic systems.
               The result is a book that captures the dynamic
               cross-disciplinary interactions that characterize the best work
               in the philosophy of psychiatry.",

  title    = "The epistemological role of empathy in psychopathological
              diagnosis: a contemporary reassessment of Karl Jaspers' account",
  author   = "Oulis, Panagiotis",
  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: In his classic essay ``The phenomenological
              approach to psychopathology'', Karl Jaspers defended the
              irreducible reality of the ``subjective'' mental symptoms and
              stressed the pivotal role of empathy in their diagnostic
              assessment. However, Jaspers' account of the epistemological role
              of empathy in psychopathological diagnosis was far from clear:
              whereas at several places Jaspers claimed that empathy provides a
              direct access to patients' abnormal mental experiences, at other
              places he stressed that it did so only indirectly, through a
              whole battery of their observable clinical indicators. The aim of
              this paper is to reassess Jaspers' account of the epistemological
              role of empathy in psychopathological diagnosis. METHODS: I
              examine thoroughly Jaspers' assertions on in the role of empathy
              in the diagnosis of ``subjective'' symptoms. Moreover, I
              explicate briefly the epistemological status of
              psychopathological diagnostic examination with the aid of the
              distinction between direct and indirect observation. RESULTS:
              Diagnostic assessment of ``subjective'' mental symptoms involves
              necessarily indirect psychopathological observation. Jaspers'
              ambiguity is traced to his failure to distinguish clearly between
              direct and indirect psychopathological observation along with his
              excessive reliance on empathy. Relatedly, Jaspers' ambiguity is
              also traced to his conflation of the semantics with the
              epistemology of psychopathological concepts representing
              patients' ``subjective'' mental symptoms. These results apply
              also to contemporary phenomenological approaches to
              psychopathological diagnostic examination which maintain that
              patients' abnormal mental experiences are invariably expressed in
              their overt behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Jaspers was right in stressing
              that psychopathological concepts of subjective mental symptoms
              represent patients' genuine abnormal experiences irreducible to
              concepts representing their associated behavioral manifestations.
              Moreover, he was right in stressing the importance of the
              empathic 'second person' approach to patients' mental
              experiences. However, he failed to recognize unambiguously that
              the epistemological access to patients' mental symptoms, though
              enormously aided by empathy, remains mainly indirect and thus
              requires also a 'third person' approach to them. Overall then,
              clinical psychopathological examination requires both a 'second'
              and a 'third' person approach, as well as their judicious
              alternation during the diagnostic interview. Although focused on
              Jaspers' essay, my critical analysis is also highly relevant to
              contemporary psychopathological approaches aiming to overcome the
              serious limitations of currently prevailing systems of diagnostic
              criteria of mental disorders.",

              tasks, theories and tools of psychopathology approaches in
              particular. RESULTS: The main tasks of psychopathology are, to
              record and describe experiential and behavioral abnormalities in
              their intersubjective context, to explain their origin from an
              objective scientific perspective, and to attempt to understand

              provide stable fundaments for the work in clinical and scientific

              induce a state of dysphoria in patients. Blockade of the dopamine
              D(2) receptors, which is thought to mediate their efficacy, has

              extrastriatal dopamine D(2) receptor binding potential and
              occupancy values and adverse subjective experience. METHOD:
              Patients with recent-onset psychosis (N=12) were randomly
              assigned to low or high doses of olanzapine or risperidone.
              Subjective experiences, motor side effects, and striatal and
              extrastriatal dopamine D(2) receptors (determined with
              [(11)C]raclopride and [(11)C]FLB 457 PET scans, respectively)
              were evaluated after 2 weeks of continuous antipsychotic
              treatment. RESULTS: Higher dopamine D(2) receptor occupancy and
              binding potentials in the striatal (dorsal and ventral),
              temporal, and insular regions were associated with subjective
              experience. The finding was confirmed with two convergent methods
              of analysis (region-of-interest and voxel-based statistics), and

              sex-corrected occupancy values). CONCLUSIONS: Higher D(2)
              receptor occupancy is associated with negative subjective

              in which overall treatment efficacy is reduced; and nocebo side
              effects, which result in the increased experience of unpleasant
              secondary side effects. An important factor in generating nocebo
              effects of both types is the patient's expectations of how well a
              treatment will work, and how likely it is to cause side effects.
              One source of negative expectations is the presence of generic-as
              opposed to brand name-labeling. A medicine's labeling is likely
              to be one of the first aspects of a treatment that is encountered
              by a patient, and perhaps the most common labeling information on
              pharmaceuticals is the labeling that identifies the drug as being
              made by the originator brand manufacturer, or as a generic copy.
              Although generic medicines are pharmaceutically equivalent to
              their brand name counterparts, generics are often viewed with
              distrust and perceived to be inferior to branded medicines.
              Negative perceptions of generic pharmaceuticals may contribute to
              reduced treatment efficacy via enhanced primary nocebo effects,
              and increased nocebo side effects. This chapter reviews evidence
              for the role of brand and generic labeling in treatment outcomes
              across a range of contexts-most often laboratory research
              assessing pain outcomes, as well as the influence of related
              factors including price, familiarity, and treatment switches.
              Although increasing evidence suggests that labeling of medicines
              can shape nocebo effects, interventions to improve perceptions of
              generics do not necessarily translate into more positive

              controlled trials (RCTs) [e.g. due to investigator expectations
              or assessment quality] can be quantified by studying the rates of
              adverse events reported in the placebo arms of such trials.
              OBJECTIVE: We compared the rates of adverse effects reported in
              the placebo arms of tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) trials and
              placebo arms of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
              trials. METHODS: We conducted a literature search for RCTs across
              PUBMED, Scopus and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
              Trials (CENTRAL). Only studies allowing adverse effect analysis
              were included. Publication year ranged from 1981 to 2007.
              RESULTS: Our systematic review and meta-analysis included 143
              placebocontrolled RCTs and data from 12,742 patients. Only 21\%
              of studies used structured and systematic adverse effect
              ascertainment strategies. The way in which trials recorded
              adverse events influenced the rate of adverse effects
              substantially. Systematic assessment led to higher rates than
              less systematic assessment. Far more adverse effects were
              reported in TCA-placebo groups compared with SSRI-placebo groups,
              e.g. dry mouth (odds ratio [OR] = 3.5; 95\% CI 2.9, 4.2);
              drowsiness (OR = 2.7; 95\%CI 2.2, 3.4); constipation (OR= 2.7;
              95\%CI 2.1, 3.6); sexual problems (OR =2.3; 95\%CI 1.5, 3.5).
              Regression analyses controlling for various influencing factors
              confirmed the results. CONCLUSION: Adverse effect profiles
              reported in clinical trials are strongly influenced by
              expectations from investigators and patients. This difference
              cannot be attributed to ascertainment methods. Adverse effect
              patterns of the drug group are closely related to adverse effects
              of the placebo group. These results question the validity of the

              relationship predicts outcome across various psychiatric
              settings. The clinician-patient relationship and communication
              may indirectly improve outcome, e.g. mediated through better
              treatment adherence. Yet, evidence suggests that these
              interpersonal processes also have a direct therapeutic effect.
              Thus, depending on the conceptual model of therapeutic processes
              they may be seen as therapy in itself. Clinicians receive little
              specific instruction and supervision in communication skills, and
              research on the issue is scarce. Whilst there are conceptual and
              methodological challenges to such research, the aim should be to
              identify therapeutically effective elements of relationships and
              communication that can be tested in experimental studies.
              Although still rare, interventions to improve clinician-patient
              communication in routine mental healthcare show favourable
              results. A further step may be adapting established psychological
              treatment models, such as cognitive behaviour or solution focused
              therapy, to make routine clinical interactions more therapeutic
              and evidence based. This would be in the interest of clinicians,
              in optimizing their therapeutic potential, and patients alike.",

              prodromal symptoms. Computerized and direct searches of the

              biological changes, from those that cannot. The distinction is
              central to clinical practice and is a key organising principle in
              diagnostic systems. Following a pragmatist approach that examines
              meaning through use, we examine how the functional-organic
              distinction is deployed and conceptualised in psychiatry and
              neurology. We note that the conceptual scope of the terms
              'functional' and 'organic' varies considerably by context.
              Techniques for differentially diagnosing 'functional' and
              'organic' diverge in the strength of evidence they produce as a
              necessary function of the syndrome in question. Clinicians do not
              agree on the meaning of the terms and report using them
              strategically. The distinction often relies on an implied model
              of 'zero sum' causality and encourages classification of
              syndromes into discrete 'functional' and 'organic' versions.
              Although this clearly applies in some instances, this is often in
              contrast to our best scientific understanding of neuropsychiatric
              disorders as arising from a dynamic interaction between personal,
              social and neuropathological factors. We also note 'functional'
              and 'organic' have loaded social meanings, creating the potential
              for social disempowerment. Given this, we argue for a better
              understanding of how strategic simplification and complex
              scientific reality limit each other in neuropsychiatric thinking.
              We also note that the contribution of people who experience the
              interaction between 'functional' and 'organic' factors has rarely
              informed the validity of this distinction and the dilemmas
              arising from it, and we highlight this as a research priority.",

              multi-site, 3-year, prospective, naturalistic, observational
              study, in which subjects with schizophrenia were assessed at
              enrollment and at 12-month intervals thereafter. Individuals who
              were ``Depressed'' (defined as a total score > or =16 on the
              Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) at enrollment were
              compared to those ``Non-depressed'' on functional outcomes, using
              self-report measures, clinicians' ratings, and information from
              medical records. Statistical analyses included Generalized
              Estimation Equation and mixed regression analyses adjusted for

              the 3-year study were augmented with a cross-sectional group
              comparison at enrollment. RESULTS: At enrollment, 39.4\%
              (877/2228) of the participants were deemed Depressed. Across the
              3-year study, the depressed cohort was significantly more likely
              than the Non-depressed to use relapse-related mental health
              services (emergency psychiatric services, sessions with
              psychiatrists); to be a safety concern (violent, arrested,

              People with schizophrenia and concurrent depressive symptoms have
              poorer long-term functional outcomes compared to the
              Non-depressed. Their poorer quality of life, greater use of

              and side effects was found to show good fit. Positive symptoms
              caused mostly anxiety symptoms and tendency to report RH items,
              whereby resulting in over-generalized reporting of subjective
              side effects. However, a large proportion of variance of side
              effects was explained by RH, which was only partially explained
              by positive symptoms alone. Therefore, patients with severe
              levels of positive and anxiety/depressive symptoms may be prone
              to nocebo-like effects of antipsychotics. Studies that include
              acute stage patients presenting severe levels of these symptoms

  abstract = "CONTEXT: The modern version of the Hippocratic Oath requires
              doctors to swear that they will apply, for the benefit of the
              sick, all measures that are required, avoiding the twin traps of
              overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism. This paper explores the
              magnitude of the problem of overtreatment and undertreatment and
              the potential sources of these treatment errors. METHODS: We
              undertook a narrative review of the literature on errors in
              treatment associated with flaws in doctors' judgements and
              present evidence from research into clinical reasoning and from
              psychological research into decision making. Based on evidence
              from these two research fields, we explored the possible reasons
              why doctors erroneously withhold or unnecessarily administer
              treatments. RESULTS: Variation in treatment has been documented,
              even with similar clinical presentations under a variety of
              conditions, suggesting that overtreatment and undertreatment
              actually occur, with adverse effects for patients. Both types of
              error have been demonstrated, even when the doctor arrived at the
              correct diagnosis. They may be associated with the influence
              exerted on doctors' treatment judgements by factors that are
              unrelated to the specific problem, such as patients'
              socio-demographic characteristics and the doctor's practice
              culture. Doctors are also subject to commission bias and to
              omission bias, which have been demonstrated to occur in several
              domains. Such biases lead doctors to administer unnecessary
              treatments or to withhold required treatments due to anticipated
              regret. Little is known about cognitive processes underlying
              doctors' treatment decisions, but mental representations of
              diseases that provide the basis for diagnostic reasoning are also
              probably used for treatment judgements. CONCLUSIONS: Doctors are
              at risk of falling into the twin traps of overtreatment and
              therapeutic nihilism. Further research should explore how to
              avoid these traps, but it may require deliberate reflection on
              problems to be solved to counteract the influence of factors that
              are beyond the patient's problem.",

              schizophrenic patients die by suicide, and it is likely that the
              higher end of range is the most accurate estimate. There is
              almost total agreement that the schizophrenic patient who is more
              likely to commit suicide is young, male, white and never married,
              with good premorbid function, post-psychotic depression and a
              history of substance abuse and suicide attempts. Hopelessness,
              social isolation, hospitalization, deteriorating health after a
              high level of premorbid functioning, recent loss or rejection,
              limited external support, and family stress or instability are
              risk factors for suicide in patients with schizophrenia. Suicidal
              schizophrenics usually fear further mental deterioration, and
              they experience either excessive treatment dependence or loss of
              faith in treatment. Awareness of illness has been reported as a
              major issue among suicidal schizophrenic patients, yet some
              researchers argue that insight into the illness does not increase
              suicide risk. Protective factors play also an important role in
              assessing suicide risk and should also be carefully evaluated.
              The neurobiological perspective offers a new approach for
              understanding self-destructive behavior among patients with
              schizophrenia and may improve the accuracy of screening
              schizophrenics for suicide. Although, there is general consensus
              on the risk factors, accurate knowledge as well as early
              recognition of patients at risk is still lacking in everyday

              suicide in schizophrenia. Each expert provided a brief essay on
              one specific aspect of the problem. This is the first attempt to
              present a consensus report as well as the development of a set of

              clinical manifestations demonstrate somewhat predictable patterns
              of expression and progression. Symptomatically, strong affects
              and positive psychotic symptoms in the early course become less
              conspicuous with time and are replaced by more thought disorder,
              disorganized behavior, negative symptoms and deficit cognitive

  abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The concept of resilience is expected to be
              relevant in understanding the heterogeneous outcomes associated
              with schizophrenia. We reviewed recent developments in clinical
              studies focusing on the biological and psychological aspects of
              resilience in this population. We aimed to clarify current
              concepts of resilience in the field, elucidate gaps in the
              literature, and provide recommendations for future research.
              RECENT FINDINGS: A total of 20 articles published between 2014
              and 2015 were included. Six studies were neuroimaging studies,
              while the remaining studies used various psychological
              assessments. Most studies were cross-sectional except for three
              studies with naturalistic follow-up, one single-blind randomized
              controlled trial, and two published protocols of prospective
              studies. The following patterns of research were evident among
              the highly heterogeneous literature: studies focusing on
              protective factors and others emphasizing dynamic processes,
              studies investigating 'at-risk but resilient' groups (e.g.
              nonpsychotic siblings of patients with schizophrenia), and
              studies using psychological scales to measure resilience.
              SUMMARY: The heterogeneity in how reports conceptualize, assess,
              and interpret resilience likely reflects the multidimensional
              nature of the concept itself and the lack of a 'gold standard' in
              assessing resilience in schizophrenia. Further research is needed
              to make recommendations on how to facilitate resilience in
              clinical care.",

              with the same agent used to achieve response in the first
              episode. The following outcomes were used as an index of

              which was associated with a very significant increase in the risk
              of development of a full-fledged psychotic disorder
              (schizophrenia spectrum, psychotic mood disorder, and other
              psychotic disorders) within the next year. At the same time, the
              majority of individuals with ``attenuated psychotic symptoms''
              had one or more other current psychiatric comorbid conditions
              (usually mood or anxiety disorders, substance use disorder;
              Fusar-Poli 2012) and exhibited a range of psychiatric outcomes
              other than conversion to psychosis (significant proportions
              either fully recover or develop some other psychiatric disorder,
              with a minority developing a psychotic disorder). Although the
              reliability of the diagnosis is well established in academic and
              research settings, it was found to be less so in community and
              other clinical settings. Furthermore, the nosological
              relationship of attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS) to
              schizotypal personality disorder and other psychiatric conditions
              was unclear. Further study will hopefully resolve these
              questions. The work group decided to recommend the inclusion of
              attenuated psychosis syndrome as a category in the appendix
              (Section 3) of DSM-5 as a condition for further study.",

              manic-depressive illness made by Kraepelin in 1899, many changes
              have occurred in the way these conditions and especially their
              boundaries are conceived. The clearest example is the
              extraordinary increase in the diagnoses of bipolar disease with
              respect to those of schizophrenia. But there have also been
              important changes within each one of these categories. In the
              first case, the separation of schizo- affective and cycloid
              psychoses, and in the second, the distinction between mono and
              bipolar disease. Then there is the description of innumerable
              forms of monopolar depression1 or, on the contrary, the
              postulation of the existence of only one endogenous-melancholic
              syndrome by Tellenbach, an idea which is shall come up again,
              although from another methodological perspective, in the concept
              of major depression of DSM III. The present author thinks that
              this state of nosological confusion has to do, on one hand, with
              the improper combination of descriptive and etiological
              criteria,and on the other, with the application of categorical
              criteria to complex realities, without an organic basis
              supporting them.The present author proposes a
              logopathies/thymopathies dichotomy. The first would include all
              forms of schizophrenia,paraphrenias and paranoias. The second
              would correspond to the affective disorders and also to a great
              part of the so called ``anxiety disorders''. In this first part
              he develops the subject of the logopathies, trying to demonstrate
              the legitimacy of the concept upon the basis of three fundamental
              arguments: (i) Alteration of the thought/language as a nucleus of
              schizophrenic suffering. (ii) Schizophrenia is a constitutive
              element of the human condition. And (iii)Schizophrenia appears as
              a perturbation of Verstehen (understanding),as described by
              Heidegger in Being and Time as one of the ways Dasein (human
              being) is present in the world, together with Befindlichkeit

              METHOD: We detailed the time characteristics of recovery in a
              study of 2848 patients (diagnosed according to DSM-III-R/DSM-IV
              criteria as having major depressive disorder or major depressive
              episode) who were treated with 7 different anti-depressants and
              placebo. A 2-dimensional cure model was used to disentangle the 2
              central aspects of psychotropic drug response: the proportion of
              patients in whom a therapeutic response is induced ( incidence)
              and the time to onset of improvement ( latency). Random-effects
              models were applied to quantify unexplained heterogeneity.
              Patients were recruited between June 1982 and May 1998. RESULTS:
              Our analyses yielded no indication for a delayed onset of
              antidepressant drug response. Rather, we found highly individual
              time characteristics of recovery along with a continuous
              distribution of the time spans to onset of improvement under
              treatment with all active compounds and placebo. The mean +/- SD
              time to onset of improvement was 13 +/- 1 days and to response
              was 19 +/- 1 days. Effective antidepressants appeared to trigger
              and maintain conditions necessary for recovery from the disorder.
              Odds-ratio analysis based on a random-effects model revealed that
              early improvers were at least 3 times more likely to become
              sustained responders with a pooled OR of 9.25, 95\% CI = 7.79 to
              10.98. CONCLUSIONS: Affectively ill patients are likely to
              possess a common, biological, ``resilience''-like component that
              largely controls recovery from depression. Once triggered,
              recovery appears to follow a pattern similar to the course
              observed with placebo, despite marked pharmacologic differences
              of the triggers. These findings may pave the way for new classes
              of psychotropic drugs specifically designed to support
              health-oriented processes underlying the natural resilience of
              patients.",

              clinical psychology and psychiatry. The aim of this systematic
              review was to critically summarize the tools that are available
              for reproducing and standardizing the clinical intuitions that
              are involved in a staging formulation. METHODS: A comprehensive
              research was conducted on the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE and
              Cochrane databases from inception to May 2012. The following
              search terms were used: 'stage/staging' AND 'psychiatric
              disorder/mental disorder/schizophrenia/mood disorder/anxiety
              disorder/substance use disorder/eating disorder'. RESULTS: A
              total of 78 studies were identified for inclusion in the review.
              We discussed studies addressing or related to the issue of
              staging in a number of mental disorders (schizophrenia, unipolar
              depression, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, substance use
              disorders, anorexia and bulimia nervosa). The literature
              indicates that disorders have a longitudinal development or a
              treatment history that can be categorized according to stages. We
              proposed staging formulations for the above-mentioned psychiatric
              disorders. CONCLUSION: Staging models offer innovative assessment
              tools for clinical psychologists and psychiatrists.
              Characterizing each stage of an illness demarcates major
              prognostic and therapeutic differences among patients who
              otherwise seem to be deceptively similar since they share the
              same psychiatric diagnosis. A stage 0 to denote an at-risk

              for age and gender underwent structural MRI brain scans at

              Significantly greater reductions in volume were detected in the

              such smaller volumes are due to the illness or to the effects of
              antipsychotic medication treatment. Indeed, we recently reported
              that chronic exposure of macaque monkeys to haloperidol or
              olanzapine, at doses producing plasma levels in the therapeutic
              range in schizophrenia subjects, was associated with
              significantly smaller total brain weight and volume, including an
              11.8-15.2\% smaller gray matter volume in the left parietal lobe.
              Consequently, in this study we sought to determine whether these

              and Cavalieri's principle on Nissl-stained sections confirmed a
              14.6\% smaller gray matter volume in the left parietal lobe from

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Previous research indicated that women are more
              vulnerable than men to adverse psychological consequences of
              weight gain. Other research has suggested that weight gain
              experienced during antipsychotic therapy may also psychologically
              impact women more negatively. This study assessed the impact of
              acute treatment-emergent weight gain on clinical and functional
              outcomes of patients with schizophrenia by patient gender and
              antipsychotic treatment (olanzapine or haloperidol). METHODS:
              Data were drawn from the acute phase (first 6-weeks) of a
              double-blind randomized clinical trial of olanzapine versus
              haloperidol in the treatment of 1296 men and 700 women with
              schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. The associations between weight
              change and change in core schizophrenia symptoms, depressive
              symptoms, and functional status were examined post-hoc for men
              and women and for each medication group. Core schizophrenia
              symptoms (positive and negative) were measured with the Brief
              Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), depressive symptoms with the
              BPRS Anxiety/Depression Scale and the Montgomery-Asberg
              Depression Rating Scale, and functional status with the mental
              and physical component scores on the Medical Outcome Survey-Short
              Form 36. Statistical analysis included methods that controlled
              for treatment duration. RESULTS: Weight gain during 6-week
              treatment with olanzapine and haloperidol was significantly
              associated with improvements in core schizophrenia symptoms,
              depressive symptoms, mental functioning, and physical functioning
              for men and women alike. The conditional probability of clinical
              response (20\% reduction in core schizophrenia symptom), given a
              clinically significant weight gain (at least 7\% of baseline
              weight), showed that about half of the patients who lost weight
              responded to treatment, whereas three-quarters of the patients
              who had a clinically significant weight gain responded to
              treatment. The positive associations between therapeutic response
              and weight gain were similar for the olanzapine and haloperidol
              treatment groups. Improved outcomes were, however, more
              pronounced for the olanzapine-treated patients, and more
              olanzapine-treated patients gained weight. CONCLUSIONS: The
              findings of significant relationships between treatment-emergent
              weight gain and improvements in clinical and functional status at
              6-weeks suggest that patients who have greater treatment-emergent
              weight gain are more likely to benefit from treatment with
              olanzapine or haloperidol regardless of gender.",

              Three hundred seventeen studies published from September 1, 1998
              to January 1, 2012 comprising over 9000 patients were selected
              for meta-analysis, including 33 studies in antipsychotic-naive

              factors such as duration of illness, sex composition, current
              antipsychotic dose, and intelligence quotient matching status of
              participants were extracted where available. In the sample of
              medicated schizophrenia patients (n = 8327), intracranial and
              total brain volume was significantly decreased by 2.0\% (effect
              size d = -0.17) and 2.6\% (d = -0.30), respectively. Largest
              effect sizes were observed for gray matter structures, with
              effect sizes ranging from -0.22 to -0.58. In the sample of
              antipsychotic-naive patients (n = 771), volume reductions in
              caudate nucleus (d = -0.38) and thalamus (d = -0.68) were more
              pronounced than in medicated patients. White matter volume was
              decreased to a similar extent in both groups, while gray matter
              loss was less extensive in antipsychotic-naive patients. Gray
              matter reduction was associated with longer duration of illness
              and higher dose of antipsychotic medication at time of scanning.
              Therefore, brain loss in schizophrenia is related to a
              combination of (early) neurodevelopmental processes-reflected in
              intracranial volume reduction-as well as illness progression.",

              insights into neuroscience and molecular biology it is necessary
              to re-evaluate this issue. Since the medical model in previous

              here is twofold: First, whether something is a mental disease can
              only be determined on the mental level. This is so because we can
              only call behavior deviant by comparing it to non-deviant
              behavior, i.e., by using norms regarding behavior. Second, from
              this it follows that psychiatric disorders cannot be completely
              reduced to the physical level even if mental processes and states

              general population, especially due to cardiovascular diseases.
              Several neurobiological systems involved in energy metabolism

              The ``selfish brain'' theory is a recent paradigm postulating
              that, in order to maintain its own energy supply stable, the
              brain modulates energy metabolism in the periphery by regulation
              of both allocation and intake of nutrients. We hypothesize that

              improvement. Mixed-effects analyses of trial-by-trial ratings
              revealed that the ``drug'' infusion cues induced higher
              expectancies of mood improvement, while both the ``drug''
              infusion cue and the sham neurofeedback induced a reported mood
              improvement. Neurofeedback of greater magnitude, compared to
              lower magnitude, recruited the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC).
              Individuals with greater lPFC responses to neurofeedback

              poorly adherent to their antipsychotics at any given time.
              However, little is known about patients' adherence over time,
              although this has important services implications. We examined
              antipsychotic adherence over 4 years at the aggregate and the

              identified 34,128 Veterans Affairs patients who received a
              schizophrenia diagnosis and an antipsychotic fill in fiscal year
              (FY) 1999, completed schizophrenia visits in each of the next 4
              years (FY2000, FY2001, FY2002, FY2003), and had valid medication
              possession ratios (MPRs) in each of these years. We examined
              whether patients had consistently good adherence (MPRs >or= 0.8
              in all 4 years), consistently poor adherence (MPRs < 0.8 in all
              years), or inconsistent adherence. We examined predictors of
              consistently poor or inconsistent adherence. RESULTS: The
              cross-sectional prevalence of poor adherence among the patient
              population remained stable over time; 36\%-37\% were poorly
              adherent in each year. However, 61\% of patients had adherence
              difficulties at some point over the 4-year period. Approximately
              18\% had consistently poor adherence, 43\% were inconsistently
              adherent, and 39\% had consistently good adherence. Patients who

              by people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia to cope with
              hallucinated voices, and considers the role of coping in
              psychological treatments for persisting symptoms. The use of
              self-initiated ('natural') coping strategies appears almost
              universal amongst voice-hearers. These strategies are similar
              across cultures, and include diverse behaviours, only a minority
              of which is specific to hallucinations. Most strategies are
              reported by at least some users to be effective, but more
              sophisticated outcome studies are lacking. Some evidence for the
              efficacy of certain behavioural techniques of coping, for the
              manipulation of auditory input, and for strategies involving
              subvocalisation, is available from experimental studies.
              Therapeutic enhancement of natural coping strategies for
              persisting symptoms has demonstrated some efficacy, but its
              benefit for voices is unknown. Despite this, it has become an

  abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The scope of the present review is to
              criticize the trivial meanings of 'psychopathology' and
              re-examine its technical meanings and the role that
              psychopathology as the discipline that studies abnormal mental
              phenomena can play in today's clinical practice and research, and
              in the conceptualization of mental disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: I
              will first describe and discuss the way the term
              'psychopathology' is mainly used in current psychiatric
              literature. This meaning, I will argue, is trivial. Then, I will
              move on to its technical meanings, including three classic
              sub-areas: descriptive, clinical and structural psychopathology,
              stemming from the studies of Karl Jaspers, Kurt Schneider and the
              phenomenological movement in psychiatry. SUMMARY: I will address
              the meanings of the term 'psychopathology' in current literature
              and contrast it with its meanings in continental 20th century
              tradition. The relevance of the discipline of psychopathology for
              psychiatry is three-fold: it is the common language that allows
              psychiatrists to understand each other; it is the basis for
              diagnosis and classification; it makes an indispensable
              contribution to understanding the patients' personal experiences.",

  abstract = "Values-based practice (VBP), developed as a partner theory to
              evidence-based medicine (EBM), takes into explicit consideration
              patients' and clinicians' values, preferences, concerns and
              expectations during the clinical encounter in order to make
              decisions about proper interventions. VBP takes seriously the
              importance of life narratives, as well as how such narratives
              fundamentally shape patients' and clinicians' values. It also
              helps to explain difficulties in the clinical encounter as
              conflicts of values. While we believe that VBP adds an important
              dimension to the clinician's reasoning and decision-making
              procedures, we argue that it ignores the degree to which values
              can shift and change, especially in the case of psychiatric
              disorders. VBP does this in three respects. First, it does not
              appropriately engage with the fact that a person's values can
              change dramatically in light of major life events. Second, it
              does not acknowledge certain changes in the way people value, or
              in their modes of valuing, that occur in cases of severe
              psychiatric disorder. And third, it does not acknowledge the fact
              that certain disorders can even alter the degree to which one is
              capable of valuing anything at all. We believe that ignoring such
              changes limits the degree to which VBP can be effectively applied
              to clinical treatment and care. We conclude by considering a
              number of possible remedies to this issue, including the use of
              proxies and written statements of value generated through
              interviews and discussions between patient and clinician.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Network analysis (NA) is an analytical tool that
              allows one to explore the map of connections and eventual dynamic
              influences among symptoms and other elements of mental disorders.
              In recent years, the use of NA in psychopathology has rapidly
              grown, which calls for a systematic and critical analysis of its
              clinical utility. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, a
              systematic review of published empirical studies applying NA in
              psychopathology, between 2010 and 2017, was conducted. We
              included the literature published in PubMed and PsycINFO using as
              keywords any combination of ``network analysis'' with the terms
              ``anxiety,'' ``affective disorders,'' ``depression,''
              ``schizophrenia,'' ``psychosis,'' ``personality disorders,''
              ``substance abuse'' and ``psychopathology.'' RESULTS: The review
              showed that NA has been applied in a plethora of mental disorders
              in adults (i.e., 13 studies on anxiety disorders; 19 on mood
              disorders; 7 on psychosis; 1 on substance abuse; 1 on borderline
              personality disorder; 18 on the association of symptoms between
              disorders), and 6 on childhood and adolescence. CONCLUSIONS: A
              critical examination of the results of each study suggests that
              NA helps to identify, in an innovative way, important aspects of
              psychopathology like the centrality of the symptoms in a given
              disorder as well as the mutual dynamics among symptoms. Yet,
              despite these promising results, the clinical utility of NA is
              still uncertain as there are important limitations on the
              analytic procedures (e.g., reliability of indices), the type of
              data included (e.g., typically restricted to secondary analysis
              of already published data), and ultimately, the psychometric and
              clinical validity of the results.",

              1913, he published the General Psychopathology (GP; Allgemeine
              Psychopathologie), the first edition. Despite the passage of one
              hundred years after the GP was published, GP still has a
              potential value to present a phenomenological and comprehensive
              viewpoint for psychiatry to overcome Kraepelinian-biological
              absolutism. The philosophical backgrounds of a Jaspersian
              phenomenological sense have been related to both the
              transcendence and the immanence roots. Partly under the influence
              of a Husserlian distinction between the natural and
              phenomenological attitudes, a rigid distinction between
              explanation and understanding has been proposed as the proper
              epistemological method in Jaspers' GP. Further, the fact that a
              distinction between process and development has been presented as
              the psychical phenomenon is understandable. The integrated and
              comprehensive viewpoint establishment for the state of

              been the legacies of Jaspers' GP. Moreover, the common
              theoretical backgrounds may be shared by the Jaspersian sense and
              humanitarian approaches in Korean psychiatry. Also, the

              frequency and severity of psychotic activity in samples of
              schizophrenia patients (SZ) treated versus those not treated with
              antipsychotic medications. METHOD: A total of 139 early young
              schizophrenia and mood-disordered patients were assessed at index
              hospitalization and then reassessed six times over 20 years for
              psychosis and other major variables. RESULTS: At each follow-up
              assessment over the 20 years, a surprisingly high percentage of
              SZ treated with antipsychotics longitudinally had psychotic
              activity. More than 70\% of SZ continuously prescribed
              antipsychotics experienced psychotic activity at four or more of
              six follow-up assessments over 20 years. Longitudinally, SZ not
              prescribed antipsychotics showed significantly less psychotic
              activity than those prescribed antipsychotics (p < 0.05).
              CONCLUSIONS: The 20-year data indicate that, longitudinally,
              after the first few years, antipsychotic medications do not
              eliminate or reduce the frequency of psychosis in schizophrenia,
              or reduce the severity of post-acute psychosis, although it is
              difficult to reach unambiguous conclusions about the efficacy of
              treatment in purely naturalistic or observational research.
              Longitudinally, on the basis of their psychotic activity and the

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Longitudinal structural MRI studies have shown that
              patients with schizophrenia have progressive brain tissue loss
              after onset. Recurrent relapses are believed to play a role in
              this loss, but the relationship between relapse and structural
              MRI measures has not been rigorously assessed. The authors
              analyzed longitudinal data to examine this question. METHODS: The
              authors studied data from 202 patients drawn from the Iowa
              Longitudinal Study of first-episode schizophrenia for whom
              adequate structural MRI data were available (N=659 scans) from
              scans obtained at regular intervals over an average of 7 years.
              Because clinical follow-up data were obtained at 6-month
              intervals, the authors were able to compute measures of relapse
              number and duration and relate them to structural MRI measures.
              Because higher treatment intensity has been associated with
              smaller brain tissue volumes, the authors also examined this
              countereffect in terms of dose-years. RESULTS: Relapse duration
              was related to significant decreases in both general (e.g., total
              cerebral volume) and regional (e.g., frontal) brain measures.
              Number of relapses was unrelated to brain measures. Significant
              effects were also observed for treatment intensity. CONCLUSIONS:
              Extended periods of relapse may have a negative effect on brain
              integrity in schizophrenia, suggesting the importance of
              implementing proactive measures that may prevent relapse and
              improve treatment adherence. By examining the relative balance of
              effects, that is, relapse duration versus antipsychotic treatment
              intensity, this study sheds light on a troublesome dilemma that
              clinicians face. Relapse prevention is important, but it should
              be sustained using the lowest possible medication dosages that
              will control symptoms.",

              into those considered to be at risk for developing psychosis.
              Much has been learned and studies have been encouraging. The aim
              of this paper is to offer an update of the current status of
              research on risk for psychosis, and what the next steps might be
              in examining the progression from CHR to psychosis. Advances have
              been made in accurate prediction, yet there are some
              methodological issues in ascertainment, diagnosis, the use of
              data-driven selection methods and lack of external validation.
              Although there have been several high-quality treatment trials
              the heterogeneity of this clinical high-risk population has to be
              addressed so that their treatment needs can be properly met.
              Recommendations for the future include more collaborative
              research programmes, and ensuring they are accessible and
              harmonized with respect to criteria and outcomes so that the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Heterogeneity in clinical outcomes may be caused by
              factors working at multiple levels, e.g., between groups, between
              subjects, or within subjects over time. A more nuanced assessment
              of differences in variation among schizophrenia patients and
              between patients and healthy comparison subjects can clarify
              etiology and even facilitate the identification of patient
              subtypes with common neuropathology and clinical course. METHODS:
              We compared trajectories (mean duration of 3.5years) of cognitive
              impairments in a sample of 201 community-dwelling schizophrenia
              (SCZ) patients (aged 40-100years) with 67 healthy comparison (HC)
              subjects. We employed growth mixture models to discover
              subclasses with more homogenous between-subject variation in
              cognitive trajectories. Post hoc analyses determined factors
              associated with class membership and class-specific correlates of
              cognitive trajectories. RESULTS: Three latent classes were
              indicated: Class 1 (85\% HC and 50\% SCZ) exhibited relatively
              high and stable trajectories of cognition, Class 2 (15\% HC and
              40\% SCZ) exhibited lower, modestly declining trajectories, and
              Class 3 (10\% SCZ) exhibited lower, more rapidly declining
              trajectories. Within the patient group, membership in Classes 2-3
              was associated with worse negative symptoms and living in a board
              and care facility. DISCUSSION: These results bridge the gap
              between schizophrenia studies demonstrating cognitive decline and
              those demonstrating stability. Moreover, a finer-grained
              characterization of heterogeneity in cognitive trajectories has
              practical implications for interventions and for case management
              of patients who show accelerated cognitive decline. Such a
              characterization requires study designs and analyses sensitive to
              between- and within-patient heterogeneity in outcomes.",

  author   = "Saha, Sukanta and Chant, David and McGrath, John",
  abstract = "CONTEXT: Despite improvements in mental health services in recent
              decades, it is unclear whether the risk of mortality in
              schizophrenia has changed over time. OBJECTIVE: To explore the
              distribution of standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for people
              with schizophrenia. DATA SOURCES: Broad search terms were used in
              MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to
              identify all studies that investigated mortality in
              schizophrenia, published between January 1, 1980, and January 31,
              2006. References were also identified from review articles,
              reference lists, and communication with authors. STUDY SELECTION:
              Population-based studies that reported primary data on deaths in
              people with schizophrenia. DATA EXTRACTION: Operationalized
              criteria were used to extract key study features and mortality
              data. DATA SYNTHESIS: We examined the distribution of SMRs and
              pooled selected estimates using random-effects meta-analysis. We
              identified 37 articles drawn from 25 different nations. The
              median SMR for all persons for all-cause mortality was 2.58
              (10\%-90\% quantile, 1.18-5.76), with a corresponding
              random-effects pooled SMR of 2.50 (95\% confidence interval,
              2.18-2.43). No sex difference was detected. Suicide was
              associated with the highest SMR (12.86); however, most of the
              major causes-of-death categories were found to be elevated in
              people with schizophrenia. The SMRs for all-cause mortality have
              increased during recent decades (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: With
              respect to mortality, a substantial gap exists between the health
              of people with schizophrenia and the general community. This
              differential mortality gap has worsened in recent decades. In
              light of the potential for second-generation antipsychotic
              medications to further adversely influence mortality rates in the
              decades to come, optimizing the general health of people with

  abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Shared decision-making (SDM) is a model of how
              doctors and patients make medical decisions, which is seen as
              very applicable to mental health. This review addresses the
              following issues: Do patients and professionals see the need for
              SDM? Does SDM actually take place for patients with
              schizophrenia? What are facilitators and barriers of SDM in
              schizophrenia treatment? What are the outcomes of SDM? RECENT
              FINDINGS: Publications in the last 18 months showed the
              following: Both patients and providers acknowledge the
              desirability of SDM. SDM occurs less often in mental health than
              desired by patients and less frequently compared with general
              practice. SDM in mental health is complex, takes time and
              involves more than just two participants; patients' lack of
              decisional capacity is seen as the major barrier. There are only
              a few interventional studies measuring the outcome of SDM;
              existing research constantly shows positive, but small effects.
              SUMMARY: SDM is highly accepted and wanted in the treatment of
              schizophrenia and related disorders, but more research is needed
              regarding how SDM can be implemented in regular care. Healthcare
              professionals need more training in how to deal with difficult

              setting or of the type of therapy used. On the other hand,
              influence and coercion occur in patient-physician relationships
              in psychiatry. We investigated the associations between patients'
              perceived coercion and the therapeutic relationship. A total of
              116 psychiatric patients, who have been admitted to the
              Psychiatric University Hospital Zurich, were interviewed using a
              structured interview. Data were collected by using Scale To
              Assess the Therapeutic Relationship (STAR) (therapeutic
              relationship) and Mac Arthur Admission Experience Survey (AES)
              (perceived coercion). Associations were investigated using
              bivariate and multivariate methods. Perceived coercion predicts
              the patients' appraisal of the therapeutic relationship. We found
              a moderate relation between the patients' and the clinicians'

              higher symptom level and a lower level of global functioning at
              admission, and higher perceived coercion is related to a more
              negative patient-therapist relationship rated by the patient.

              relationship between the patient and the clinician. This

              whether these key characteristics of the disorder are due to
              schizophrenia being a degenerative disorder has been discussed
              for more than 100 years. Neuropsychological data indicate that
              neurocognitive functions are relatively stable over time after
              illness onset. Several studies show that there is a decline in
              neurocognitive functioning prior to and in connection with onset
              of illness. There is no convincing evidence, however, that there
              is a progressive neurodegenerative process after onset of
              illness. Morphological data, on the other hand, indicate a
              degenerative process. Several novel longitudinal studies indicate

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A structural neuroanatomical change indicating a
              reduction in brain tissue is a notable feature of schizophrenia.
              Several pathophysiological processes such as aberrant cortical
              maturation, progressive tissue loss and compensatory tissue
              increase could contribute to the structural changes seen in
              schizophrenia. METHOD: We studied cortical thickness using
              surface-based morphometry in 98 clinically stable patients with
              schizophrenia and 83 controls. Using a pattern classification
              approach, we studied whether the features that discriminate
              patients from controls vary across the different stages of the
              illness. Using a covariance analysis, we also investigated if
              concurrent increases accompany decreases in cortical thickness.
              RESULTS: Very high levels of accuracy (96.3\%), specificity
              (98.8\%) and sensitivity (88\%) were noted when classifying
              patients with <2 years of illness from controls. Within the
              patient group, reduced thickness was consistently accompanied by
              increased thickness in distributed brain regions. A pattern of
              cortical amelioration or normalization (i.e. reduced deviation
              from controls) was noted with increasing illness duration. While
              temporo-limbic and fronto-parietal regions showed reduced
              thickness, the occipital cortex showed increased thickness,
              especially in those with a long-standing illness. CONCLUSION: A
              compensatory remodelling process might contribute to the cortical
              thickness variations in different stages of schizophrenia. Subtle
              cerebral reorganization reflecting the inherent plasticity of
              brain may occur concomitantly with processes contributing to
              tissue reduction in adult patients with schizophrenia.",

              frequency of voices as a pleasurable experience in a psychotic
              patient population. METHOD: A total of 160 patients with AHs (89

              psychotic symptom rating scale (PSYRATS) for AHs, including an
              added item on whether the experience was pleasurable. RESULTS:
              Twenty-eight patients (26\%) reported the voices as a pleasurable
              experience and 10 of them did so frequently. Pleasurable
              hallucinations showed negative associations with amount and

              impairment that is widely believed to remain stable after illness
              onset. Yet, to date, 10-year prospective studies of cognitive
              functioning following the first episode with good methodology are
              rare. The authors examined whether schizophrenia patients
              experience cognitive decline after the first episode, whether
              this decline is generalized or confined to individual
              neuropsychological functions, and whether decline is specific to
              schizophrenia. METHODS: Participants were from a population-based
              case-control study of patients with first-episode psychosis who
              were followed prospectively up to 10 years after first admission.
              A neuropsychological battery was administered at index
              presentation and at follow-up to patients with a diagnosis of
              schizophrenia (N=65) or other psychoses (N=41) as well as to
              healthy comparison subjects (N=103). RESULTS: The schizophrenia
              group exhibited declines in IQ and in measures of verbal
              knowledge and of memory, but not processing speed or executive
              functions. Processing speed and executive function impairments
              were already present at the first episode and remained stable
              thereafter. The magnitude of declines ranged between 0.28 and
              0.66 standard deviations. Decline in measures of memory was not
              specific to schizophrenia and was also apparent in the group of
              patients with other psychoses. Healthy individuals with low IQ
              showed no evidence of decline, suggesting that a decline is
              specific to psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with schizophrenia
              and other psychoses experience cognitive decline after illness
              onset, but the magnitude of decline varies across cognitive
              functions. Distinct mechanisms consequent to the illness and/or
              psychosocial factors may underlie impairments across different
              cognitive functions.",

              schizophrenia trials have decreased over the past decades.
              Previous studies have tried to identify potential explanatory
              factors focusing on response to placebo; however, it is still not
              clear which factors, if any, specifically moderate drug-response,
              as they may be different from those moderating placebo-response.
              Therefore, in this meta-regression analysis we explore whether
              there is an interaction between drug-response and
              placebo-response in terms of effect size. We systematically
              searched multiple electronic databases, ClinicalTrials.gov, and
              the US Food and Drug Administration website for randomized,
              placebo-controlled trials investigating the efficacy of
              antipsychotics in patients with acute schizophrenia (last update:
              October 2016). The main outcome was the change on the Brief
              Psychiatric Rating Scale or the Positive and Negative Syndrome
              Scale score from baseline to endpoint after at least 3 weeks of
              treatment. Multiple patient-, design-, and drug-related potential
              predictors of response were analyzed by meta-regressions, as
              predefined in the study protocol. Overall, 167 trials with 28,102
              participants were included. Publication year, the number of
              participants and sites, mean dose, minimum severity threshold as
              an inclusion criterion, chronicity, industry sponsorship, type of
              rating scale, diagnostic criteria, and number of medications had
              a different impact on drug and placebo response. By contrast,
              baseline severity, duration of wash-out, study duration, and
              study region affected drug and placebo response in a similar way
              without a net effect on effect sizes. No other factors had a
              significant effect on either drug-response or placebo-response.
              In conclusion, as individual moderators may have different impact
              on placebo-response and drug-response, it is important to
              consider also the specific factors influencing drug-response in
              order to fully understand the difference between antipsychotics
              and placebo. These results shed further light on the phenomenon
              of decreasing effect size of antipsychotics for schizophrenia
              over time and should help design future randomized controlled

  abstract = "Treatment-resistant schizophrenia is the object of intense
              interest because of recent developments in its treatment and
              aetiology. The actual definition of treatment-resistant
              schizophrenia is, however, still controversial. It should reflect
              the legitimate and varied needs and perspectives of people with
              schizophrenia, their family members, mental health care givers,
              mental health administrators, public health officials, and those
              who fund the direct and indirect costs of treating schizophrenia.
              The most common definition of treatment-resistant schizophrenia
              denotes patients with schizophrenia who, despite at least two
              adequate trials of classical neuroleptic drugs, have persistent
              moderate to severe positive, or disorganisation, or negative
              symptoms together with poor social and work function over a
              prolonged period of time. This definition reflects the viewpoint
              of people with this illness, their family members, and mental
              health care givers. Approximately 30\% (range 10-45\%) of
              schizophrenic patients meet these criteria. While this definition
              is adequate for many purposes, it should be realised that the
              remaining 70\% of schizophrenic patients, whose positive symptoms
              respond adequately to neuroleptic treatment, may also have
              clinically significant negative symptoms, poor social and work
              function, clinically significant cognitive dysfunction, poor
              quality of life relative to the normal population, and constitute
              a significant burden to family and society. The lifetime suicide
              rate in both treatment-resistant and responsive schizophrenic
              patients is 9-13\%, indicating that conventional definitions of
              neuroleptic response do not convey lower risk of suicide.
              However, before defining a patient as treatment resistant, it is
              important to consider whether the patient has received an
              inadequate duration of treatment, and/or too low, or possibly too
              high, doses of neuroleptic drugs. Using these stringent criteria,
              treatment resistance may be present at the time of initial
              diagnosis and treatment, but if not present initially, it will
              usually develop subsequently-sometimes not until after multiple
              acute exacerbations over a period of years. During the first
              months and years after the diagnosis of schizophrenia has been
              made, clinicians should be especially alert in identifying a
              patient as treatment resistant in order to diminish the severe
              social disability and suicidality which may ensue if it is not
              recognised and correctly treated. Once present, treatment
              resistance is usually permanent. However, some
              treatment-resistant patients may again become responsive to
              treatment or undergo spontaneous remission of positive symptoms
              in later life. The treatment of patients with schizophrenia who
              are treatment resistant is generally much more expensive that
              that of neuroleptic-responsive patients because their
              symptomatology and disturbed behaviour leads to more frequent and
              longer duration hospitalisations. Patients with
              treatment-resistant schizophrenia may manifest one or more of the
              classical subtypes of schizophrenia which may differ biologically
              in terms of neurochemistry and structural brain abnormalities,
              e.g. ventricular enlargement. They usually have poorer premorbid
              function, an earlier age at onset of positive symptoms, are more
              likely to be male than female, and may have various quantitative
              types of cortical or ventricular abnormalities evident with
              computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans. There
              are no established qualitative differences in cognitive
              dysfunction between the two groups of patients with
              schizophrenia, but cognitive impairment is more severe in
              treatment-resistant patients. Treatment-resistant schizophrenia
              does not usually respond to increased dosages of neuroleptic
              drugs, switching to other types of neuroleptics, or adding
              adjunctive agents such as benzodiazepines, antidepressants,
              anticonvulsants or lithium carbonate. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",

  abstract = "In alternative medicine, the main question regarding placebo has
              been whether a given therapy has more than a placebo effect. Just
              as mainstream medicine ignores the clinical significance of its
              own placebo effect, the placebo effect of unconventional medicine
              is disregarded except for polemics. This essay looks at the
              placebo effect of alternative medicine as a distinct entity. This
              is done by reviewing current knowledge about the placebo effect
              and how it may pertain to alternative medicine. The term placebo
              effect is taken to mean not only the narrow effect of a dummy
              intervention but also the broad array of nonspecific effects in
              the patient-physician relationship, including attention;
              compassionate care; and the modulation of expectations, anxiety,
              and self-awareness. Five components of the placebo
              effect--patient, practitioner, patient-practitioner interaction,
              nature of the illness, and treatment and setting--are examined.
              Therapeutic patterns that heighten placebo effects are especially
              prominent in unconventional healing, and it seems possible that
              the unique drama of this realm may have ``enhanced'' placebo
              effects in particular conditions. Ultimately, only prospective
              trials directly comparing the placebo effects of unconventional
              and mainstream medicine can provide reliable evidence to support
              such claims. Nonetheless, the possibility of enhanced placebo
              effects raises complex conundrums. Can an alternative ritual with
              only nonspecific psychosocial effects have more positive health
              outcomes than a proven, specific conventional treatment? What
              makes therapy legitimate, positive clinical outcomes or

              perspectives and from diverse fields. Our first commentary in
              CAPMH, which grew out of our first workshop, explained our method
              and explored the controversies in general. This commentary, which
              grows out of our second workshop, explains why informed people
              can disagree about ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Based on what
              workshop participants said and our understanding of the
              literature, we make 8 points. (1) The ADHD label is based on the
              interpretation of a heterogeneous set of symptoms that cause
              impairment. (2) Because symptoms and impairments are dimensional,
              there is an inevitable ``zone of ambiguity,'' which reasonable
              people will interpret differently. (3) Many other variables, from
              different systems and tools of diagnosis to different parenting
              styles and expectations, also help explain why behaviors
              associated with ADHD can be interpreted differently. (4) Because
              people hold competing views about the proper goals of psychiatry
              and parenting, some people will be more, and others less,
              concerned about treating children in the zone of ambiguity. (5)
              To recognize that nature has written no bright line between
              impaired and unimpaired children, and that it is the
              responsibility of humans to choose who should receive a
              diagnosis, does not diminish the significance of ADHD. (6) Once
              ADHD is diagnosed, the facts surrounding the most effective
              treatment are complicated and incomplete; contrary to some
              popular wisdom, behavioral treatments, alone or in combination
              with low doses of medication, can be effective in the long-term
              reduction of core ADHD symptoms and at improving many aspects of
              overall functioning. (7) Especially when a child occupies the
              zone of ambiguity, different people will emphasize different
              values embedded in the pharmacological and behavioral approaches.
              (8) Truly informed decision-making requires that parents (and to
              the extent they are able, children) have some sense of the
              complicated and incomplete facts regarding the diagnosis and
              treatment of ADHD.",

  title    = "Problems with early and very early intervention in psychosis",
  author   = "Warner, Richard",
  abstract = "``Early intervention'' can refer to two different
              approaches--intervention when the psychosis is already evident
              and intervention before a psychosis is fully apparent. Each
              carries a distinctly different set of risks. The hoped-for
              benefits of early intervention in a fully evident psychosis are
              based on research that reveals an association between
              intervention early in the illness and good outcome. Those
              suffering from a psychosis of recent onset, however, are more
              likely to experience a spontaneous remission of illness, and this
              may readily explain the observed association. Early intervention
              in such cases of good-prognosis psychosis may lead to unnecessary
              and, sometimes, protracted treatment for those who would do well
              with no treatment. Intervention in the supposed prodromal phase
              of psychosis presents more serious hazards. The screening
              instruments currently available are inadequate for the accurate
              prediction of psychosis, and the risks of negative effects for
              the large numbers of people who screen false-positive are
              considerable. These risks include unnecessary fear of illness,
              restriction of life goals, use of medication and their

              test-retest reliability, sensitivity to medication change and
              concurrent validity of two test instruments: the Subjective
              Well-Being Under Neuroleptics (SWN) and the Subjective Deficit
              Syndrome Scale (SDSS). METHODS: Both instruments were used at
              admission and after 6 weeks of medication stabilization in 105
              consecutively admitted patients diagnosed with DSM-IV (Diagnostic
              and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edn) diagnoses of
              recent-onset schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder or
              schizoaffective disorder. RESULTS: Almost all patients were
              capable of reproducing their subjective experience in a
              consistent way both before and after medication stabilization.
              The internal consistency of both instruments was high. The
              test-retest reliability was high if medication was not changed,
              especially for the SWN. The SWN was sensitive for changes in
              medication and dosage. The short form of the SWN (SWN-20 items)
              had comparable psychometric qualities to the original instrument
              (SWN-38 items). The concurrent validity of the SWN and the SDSS
              was good, indicating that both tests measure the same concept.
              CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of subjective experience with the SWN
              (both versions) may be used in evaluating differential effects of
              anti-psychotics and dose on subjective well-being.",

              available evidence and put it in the context of clinical
              practice. This narrative review pools evidence from observational
              and experimental studies in humans and animals on the
              relationship between antipsychotic medication use and brain
              structure and function in patients with schizophrenia. To
              summarize, the observational evidence in patients with
              schizophrenia and the experimental evidence in animals suggest
              that antipsychotic drugs can cause reductions in brain volume,
              but differ as to where those effects are manifest. The
              experimental evidence in patients is inconclusive. There is
              stronger and more consistent evidence that other factors, such as
              alcohol and cannabis use, are likely causes of progressive brain
              changes in schizophrenia. Overall, I argue the case against
              antipsychotics is not proven and the jury is out on any
              significance of putative antipsychotic-induced brain changes.
              Taken in the context of strong evidence from clinical trials that
              antipsychotic drugs have beneficial effects on symptoms,
              function, relapse and cognition, and observational evidence that
              treatment normalizes other imaging indices and reduces mortality,

              gained some support in studies of non-clinical populations. This
              study reports a clinical validation of the Beliefs about Paranoia
              Scale (BaPS), a self-report measure to assess metacognitive
              beliefs about paranoia. We aimed to replicate the factor
              structure of a brief version of the measure and test the specific
              hypotheses that positive beliefs about paranoia would predict
              levels of suspiciousness, and that negative beliefs about
              paranoia would predict problematic persecutory delusions. METHOD.
              A total of 122 patients meeting criteria for a diagnosis of a
              schizophrenia spectrum disorder completed the questionnaire
              assessing beliefs about paranoia. In addition, 61 of the
              participants were administered the Structured Clinical Interview
              for DSM-IV, and 60 were administered the Positive and Negative
              Syndromes of Schizophrenia Scale. One hundred and seventy-eight
              non-patients were also recruited (an undergraduate sample).
              RESULTS. Principal components factor analysis showed that the
              three-factor solution was replicated (comprising negative beliefs
              about paranoia, paranoia as a survival strategy, and normalizing
              beliefs). This measure showed good internal consistency (alphas
              ranged from .85 to .91). Correlational analyses revealed that
              positive beliefs about paranoia were positively associated with
              levels of suspiciousness, and independent t tests showed that
              negative beliefs about paranoia were significantly higher in
              patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia meeting criteria for
              persecutory delusions in comparison to those without. Analyses of
              covariance showed that patients scored higher than non-patients
              on both positive and negative beliefs, but logistic regression
              did not demonstrate that co-occurrence of these beliefs predicted
              patient status. CONCLUSIONS. Three of our four hypotheses were
              confirmed, suggesting that a metacognitive approach to the
              conceptualization of paranoia as a strategy for managing
              interpersonal threat may have some utility for understanding
              clinical paranoia. Such a model is described and the clinical

              symptoms. Patients and family members found these states equally
              preferable (P <0.007 for differences between groups).
              CONCLUSIONS: There are systematic differences in values for
              health outcomes between patients and HCPs with regard to states
              with adverse effects of antipsychotic drugs. Family members of
              patients in general had values that were more similar to those of
              patients than were those of health professionals. The results
              emphasize the importance of participation by patients (or family
              member proxies) in clinical decision making and guideline
              development.",

              treatment in people with schizophrenia?",
  author   = "Correll, Christoph U and Rubio, Jose M and Kane, John M",
  abstract = "The long-term benefit-to-risk ratio of sustained antipsychotic
              treatment for schizophrenia has recently been questioned. In this
              paper, we critically examine the literature on the long-term
              efficacy and effectiveness of this treatment. We also review the
              evidence on the undesired effects, the impact on physical
              morbidity and mortality, as well as the neurobiological
              correlates of chronic exposure to antipsychotics. Finally, we
              summarize factors that affect the risk-benefit ratio. There is
              consistent evidence supporting the efficacy of antipsychotics in
              the short term and mid term following stabilization of acute
              psychotic symptoms. There is insufficient evidence supporting the
              notion that this effect changes in the long term. Most, but not
              all, of the long-term cohort studies find a decrease in efficacy
              during chronic treatment with antipsychotics. However, these
              results are inconclusive, given the extensive risk of bias,
              including increasing non-adherence. On the other hand, long-term
              studies based on national registries, which have lower risk of
              bias, find an advantage in terms of effectiveness during
              sustained antipsychotic treatment. Sustained antipsychotic
              treatment has been also consistently associated with lower
              mortality in people with schizophrenia compared to no
              antipsychotic treatment. Nevertheless, chronic antipsychotic use
              is associated with metabolic disturbance and tardive dyskinesia.
              The latter is the clearest undesired clinical consequence of
              brain functioning as a potential result of chronic antipsychotic
              exposure, likely from dopaminergic hypersensitivity, without
              otherwise clear evidence of other irreversible neurobiological
              changes. Adjunctive psychosocial interventions seem critical for
              achieving recovery. However, overall, the current literature does
              not support the safe reduction of antipsychotic dosages by 50\%
              or more in stabilized individuals receiving adjunctive
              psychosocial interventions. In conclusion, the critical appraisal
              of the literature indicates that, although chronic antipsychotic
              use can be associated with undesirable neurologic and metabolic
              side effects, the evidence supporting its long-term efficacy and
              effectiveness, including impact on life expectancy, outweighs the
              evidence against this practice, overall indicating a favorable
              benefit-to-risk ratio. However, the finding that a minority of
              individuals diagnosed initially with schizophrenia appear to be
              relapse free for long periods, despite absence of sustained
              antipsychotic treatment, calls for further research on
              patient-level predictors of positive outcomes in people with an

              akathisia, based on the principles of evidence-based medicine,
              and to explore a possible link between akathisia and suicidal
              behaviour (suicidal thinking, parasuicide and completed suicide).
              An extensive systematic search was carried out on three major
              databases, Embase, ClinPsych and Medline. Fifty-seven relevant
              references were found, and a further 26 references were reviewed
              after careful selection from the references of the original
              references. The Cochrane Library did not contain any systematic
              reviews on the subject. Akathisia can be caused by several
              different groups of drugs, but most frequently by antipsychotics
              and to a lesser extent antidepressants. Research into akathisia
              is made considerably more difficult by the lack of a universally
              agreed definition of the condition. The underlying
              pathophysiology is still far from clear, but the literature
              offers guidelines on less hazardous management regimes for
              patients. On the basis of the existing literature, akathisia
              cannot at this stage unequivocally be linked to suicidal
              behaviour. It is certain, however, that the condition of
              akathisia does cause considerable distress in an already
              vulnerable group of patients. Because it is largely avoidable,
              new, more rigorous strategies must be put in place to prevent it.

              {Treatment-A} Multiperspective Qualitative Study",
  author   = "Jaeger, Susanne and H{\"u}ther, Franziska and Steinert, Tilman",
  abstract = "Objective: Between June 2012 and February 2013, two decisions by
              the German Federal Constitutional Court restricted the so-far
              common practice to use involuntary medication in inpatients who
              were involuntarily hospitalized. Up to then, involuntary
              medication was justified by a judge's decision on involuntary
              hospitalization. It could be applied according to clinical
              judgment even against the declared will of a patient. Since then,
              all domestic laws related to involuntary treatment had to be
              revised. For several months, involuntary medication was allowed
              only in an emergency. We were interested in the impact of the
              changed legal framework on the experiences of inpatients, their
              relatives, and clinical professionals during that time. Methods:
              Thirty-two interviews were analyzed qualitatively using a
              grounded theory methodology framework. Results: As a consequence
              of the restrictions to involuntary medication, special efforts by
              nursing and medical staff were required concerning de-escalation,
              ward management, and the promotion of treatment commitment in
              inpatients who refused medication. Family caregivers were also
              under strong pressure. They wanted to help and to protect their
              relatives, but some also welcomed the use of coercion if the
              patient refused treatment. Most of the interviewed patients had
              not even noticed that their rights to refuse medication had been
              strengthened. They complained primarily about the involuntary
              hospital stay and the associated limitations of their everyday
              lives. While patients and family members evaluated the refusal of
              medication from a biographical perspective, the mental health
              care professionals' focus was on the patients' symptoms, and they
              understood the situation from a professional perspective. It was
              obvious that, in any of the four perspectives, the problem of
              feeling restricted was crucial and that all groups strived to
              gain back their scope of action. Conclusion: The temporary ban on
              involuntary medication questioned the hitherto common routines in
              inpatient treatment, in particular when patients refused to take
              medication. Each of the different groups did not feel good about
              the situation, for different reasons, however. As a consequence,
              it might be indispensable to increase awareness of the different
              perspectives and to focus the efforts on the establishment of
              nonviolent treatment structures and practices.",

              Antipsychotic Treatment in {First-Episode} Schizophrenia",
  author   = "Tiihonen, Jari and Tanskanen, Antti and Taipale, Heidi",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: It is generally believed that after the first episode
              of schizophrenia, the risk of relapse decreases with time in
              patients who are stabilized. Many treatment guidelines recommend
              that after stabilization, antipsychotic treatment should be
              continued for 1-5 years, and longer exposure should be avoided if
              possible. However, there is no published evidence to substantiate
              this view. The authors used nationwide databases to investigate
              this issue. METHOD: Prospectively gathered nationwide register
              data were used to study the risk of treatment failure
              (psychiatric rehospitalization or death) after discontinuation of
              antipsychotic treatment. Multivariate Cox regression was used to
              assess outcomes among all patients hospitalized for the first
              time with a schizophrenia diagnosis in Finland during the period
              of 1996-2014 (N=8,719). RESULTS: The lowest risk of
              rehospitalization or death was observed for patients who received
              antipsychotic treatment continuously (adjusted hazard
              ratio=1.00), followed by patients who discontinued antipsychotic
              use immediately after discharge from the first hospital treatment
              (hazard ratio=1.63, 95\% CI=1.52-1.75), within 1 year (hazard
              ratio=1.88, 95\% CI=1.57-2.24), within 1-2 years (hazard
              ratio=2.12, 95\% CI=1.43-3.14), within 2-5 years (hazard
              ratio=3.26, 95\% CI=2.07-5.13), and after 5 years (a median of
              7.9 years) (hazard ratio=7.28, 95\% CI=2.78-19.05). Risk of death
              was 174\%-214\% higher among nonusers and patients with early
              discontinuation of antipsychotics compared with patients who
              received antipsychotic treatment continuously for up to 16.4
              years. CONCLUSIONS: Whatever the underlying mechanisms, these
              results provide evidence that, contrary to general belief, the
              risk of treatment failure or relapse after discontinuation of
              antipsychotic use does not decrease as a function of time during
              the first 8 years of illness, and that long-term antipsychotic
              treatment is associated with increased survival.",

              disorder with defects involving many biochemical pathways.
              Patients with SZ show variable responses to current
              pharmacological treatments of SZ because of the heterogeneity of
              this disorder. Stress has a significant role in the
              pathophysiological pathways and therapeutic responses of SZ.
              Atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPDs) can modulate the stress
              response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and
              exert therapeutic effects on stress by targeting the prefrontal
              cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. To evaluate the effects of AAPDs
              (such as clozapine, risperidone and aripiprazole) on stress, we
              compared neurochemical profile variations in the PFC and
              hippocampus between rat models of chronic unpredictable mild
              stress (CUMS) for HPA axis activation and of long-term
              dexamethasone exposure (LTDE) for HPA axis inhibition, using an
              ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
              (UPLC-MS/MS)-based metabolomic approach and a multicriteria
              assessment. We identified a number of stress-induced biomarkers
              comprising creatine, choline, inosine, hypoxanthine, uric acid,
              allantoic acid, lysophosphatidylcholines (LysoPCs),
              phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), corticosterone and progesterone.
              Specifically, pathway enrichment and correlation analyses
              suggested that stress induces oxidative damage by disturbing the
              creatine-phosphocreatine circuit and purine pathway, leading to
              excessive membrane breakdown. Moreover, our data suggested that
              the AAPDs tested partially restore stress-induced deficits by
              increasing the levels of creatine, progesterone and PEs. Thus,
              the present findings provide a theoretical basis for the
              hypothesis that a combined therapy using adenosine triphosphate
              fuel, antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids as supplements may
              have synergistic effects on the therapeutic outcome following

              reduction of psychiatric symptoms and functional disabilities
              ('clinical recovery'), while the second describes the individual
              adaptation process to the threat posed to the individual sense of
              self by the disorder and its negative consequences ('personal
              recovery'). Evidence suggests that both perceptions contribute
              substantially to the understanding of recovery and require
              specific assessment and therapy. While current reviews of
              measures of clinical recovery exist, measures of personal
              recovery have yet to be investigated. Considering the steadily
              growing literature on recovery, this article gives an update
              about existing measures assessing personal recovery. METHOD: A
              literature search for instruments was performed using Medline,
              Embase, PsycINFO\&PSYNDEXPlus, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane
              Library. Inclusion criteria were: (1) quantitative self-report
              measures; (2) specifically developed for adults with
              schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder or at least applied to
              individuals suffering from severe mental illness; (3) empirically
              tested psychometric properties and/or published in a
              peer-reviewed, English-language journal. Instruments were
              evaluated with regard to psychometric properties (validity and
              reliability) and issues of application (user and administrator
              friendliness, translations). RESULTS: Thirteen instruments met
              the inclusion criteria. They were individually described and
              finally summarized in a table reflecting the pros and cons of
              each instrument. This may enable the reader to make an
              evidence-based choice for a questionnaire for a specific
              application. CONCLUSION: The Recovery Assessment Scale is
              possibly the best currently available measure of personal
              recovery when all evaluation criteria are included. However, the
              ratings listed in the current paper depended on the availability
              of information and the quality of available reports of previous
              assessment of the measurement properties. Considering the
              significant amount of information lacking and inconsistent
              findings, further research on the reviewed measures is perhaps
              more important than the development of new measures of personal
              recovery.",

              basic phenomenological features of auditory hallucinations by
              performing a factor analytic study of the MASAH ratings of 214
              patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Four
              identified factors were intractability, delusion, influence, and

              scales that were assumed to represent the features. The

              been increasing criticism of the current state of clinical
              treatment of such individuals as technological developments in
              medication provide little, if any, improvement in the lived

              medication in the treatment of 'common factors' such as the
              therapeutic relationship (TR). The TR is well researched in
              psychotherapy settings; however, the components of beneficial TRs
              in the treatment of individuals with psychotic disorders are
              poorly understood. A critical interpretive synthesis was
              conducted to determine the current understanding of the TRs
              between individuals with psychotic disorders and their clinicians
              in community case management settings. A search of MEDLINE,
              PsycINFO, EMBASE and Social Policy and Practice Databases and
              grey literature between 1990 and 2011 identified 13 papers to be
              included in the synthesis. Three key components of beneficial TRs
              were identified: mutual trust, demonstration of mutual respect
              and shared decision-making. However, the synthesis revealed that
              such interactions are difficult to achieve in routine practice.
              The main barrier identified was a lack of clarity regarding the
              goal of interactions, which in turn created stakeholders with
              poorly defined roles and possibly oppositional needs. In this
              context of ambiguity, clinicians appear to de-emphasise
              interactions characteristic of beneficial TRs, and prioritise
              interactions that protect the SU and themselves in the case of a
              relapse. Structural symbolic interactionism is used to interpret
              these findings. For interactions characteristic of TRs to be
              prioritised in the treatment of individuals with psychotic
              disorders, a clearer evidence base for the importance of the TR

              psychosis (supersensitivity psychosis) following clozapine
              withdrawal was found and weaker evidence that this might occur
              with some other antipsychotic drugs. Some cases were reported in
              people without a psychiatric history. It appears that the
              psychosis may be a feature of drug withdrawal rather than the

  author   = "Stanghellini, Giovanni and Rossi, Rodolfo",
  abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Mental disorders are mainly characterized via
              symptom assessment. Symptoms are state-like macroscopic anomalies
              of behaviour, experience, and expression that are deemed relevant
              for diagnostic purposes. An alternative approach is based on the
              concept of endophenotypes, which are physiological or behavioural
              measures occupying the terrain between symptoms and risk
              genotypes. We will critically discuss these two approaches, and
              later focus on the concept of pheno-phenotype as it is revealed
              by recent phenomenological research on schizophrenia. RECENT
              FINDINGS: Several studies have been recently published on the
              schizophrenic pheno-phenotype mainly addressing self-disorders,
              as well as disorders of time and bodily experience. SUMMARY: The
              mainstream approach to psychopathological phenotypes is focussed
              on easy-to-assess operationalizable symptoms. Thinness of
              phenotypes and simplification of clinical constructs are the
              consequences of this. Also, this approach has not been successful
              in investigating the biological causes of mental disorders. An
              integrative approach is based on the concept of 'endophenotype'.
              Endophenotypes were conceptualized as a supportive tool for the
              genetic dissection of psychiatric disorders. The underlying
              rationale states that disease-specific phenotypes should be the
              upstream phenotypic manifestation of a smaller genotype than the
              whole disease-related genotype. Psychopathological phenotypes can
              also be characterized in terms of pheno-phenotypes. This approach
              aims at delineating the manifold phenomena experienced by
              patients in all of their concrete and distinctive features, so
              that the features of a pathological condition emerge, while
              preserving their peculiar feel, meaning, and value for the
              patient. Systematic explorations of anomalies in the patients'
              experience, for example, of time, space, body, self, and
              otherness, may provide a useful integration to the symptom-based
              and endophenotype-based approaches. These abnormal phenomena can
              be used as pointers to the fundamental alterations of the
              structure of subjectivity characterizing each mental disorder.",

              technical advances, however, psychopathology has been
              increasingly marginalized by neurobiological, genetic, and
              neuropsychological research. This ongoing erosion of psychiatric
              phenomenology is further fostered by clinical casualness as well
              as pressured health care and research systems. The skill to
              precisely and carefully assess psychopathology in a qualified
              manner used to be a core attribute of mental health
              professionals, but today's curricula pay increasingly less
              attention to its training, thus blurring the border between
              pathology and variants of the ``normal'' further. Despite all
              prophecies that psychopathology was doomed, and with
              neurobiological parameters having yet to show their
              differential-diagnostic superiority and value for differential
              indication, psychiatric diagnosis continues to rely exclusively
              on psychopathology in DSM-5 and ICD-11. Their categorical
              systematic, however, is equally challenged, and, supported by
              advances in machine learning, a personalized symptom-based
              approach to precision psychiatry is increasingly advocated. The

              neurobiological changes to patients' experiences to giving a
              framework to the psychiatric encounter. It concludes that

              psychologists and psychiatrists have attempted to import
              philosophical notions associated with the self into the empirical
              study of pathological (self-)experience. In particular, so-called
              ipseity disturbances have been put forward as generative of
              symptoms of schizophrenia, and several attempts have been made to
              operationalize and measure kinds and degrees of ipseity
              disturbances in schizophrenia. However, we find that this work
              faces challenges caused by the fact that (a) the notion of
              ipseity is used ambiguously, both in the philosophical and in the
              empirical discussion, and (b) the methods employed to
              operationalize ipseity often portray a rather different
              understanding of the notion from that found in the
              (phenomenological) literature that is cited as providing the
              philosophical foundation for the studies in question. In
              particular, according to the definitions found in the
              philosophical literature, while being phenomenologically

  abstract = "An increase in placebo response is often cited as rationale for
              the continuously diminishing drug-placebo differences in
              randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating antipsychotic and
              antidepressant drugs. As a consequence, the probability for
              negative study results in placebo-controlled RCTs grows. This
              alarming trend conveys the impression that the newer marked
              psychopharmacological medications are less efficacious compared
              to the older ones although particularly trial methodological
              reasons contribute to the mitigation of the drug-placebo
              contrasts over the last decades. With regard to antipsychotic
              RCTs, the present article aims to elucidate the magnitude of the
              raising placebo response, factors contributing to this increase,
              and potential reasons for this phenomenon. Therefore, we
              summarize and critically discuss the findings of two recent
              meta-analyses on this topic. Both research projects revealed that
              the mean improvement of schizophrenic symptoms in the placebo
              groups of antipsychotic trials increased considerably over time.
              Factors that were significantly associated with larger placebo
              response in antipsychotic trials comprise with respect to
              participants characteristics younger age and shorter duration of
              illness. The results in terms of symptom severity at baseline
              were conflictive. In terms of trial methodology factors, shorter
              study duration, a larger number of study sites and participants,
              fewer academic/university sites, and a lower percentage of

              more adherent with their medication and explored patient factors

              1998, and September 30, 1999, were identified in the VA National
              Psychosis Registry. We calculated medication possession ratios
              (MPRs) for patients filling prescriptions for one (n = 49,003) or
              two (n = 14,211) antipsychotics during the year. We examined
              cross-sectional relationships among adherence, type of
              antipsychotic, and patient characteristics and explored adherence
              among patients switching antipsychotics during the year. Among
              patients receiving one antipsychotic, 40 percent had MPRs < 0.8,
              indicating poor adherence. African-Americans and younger patients
              were more likely to be poorly adherent. Cross-sectionally,

              confirm that poor adherence is common. African-Americans and
              younger patients are particularly at risk. Unfortunately,

  title    = "Is schizophrenia disappearing? The rise and fall of the diagnosis
              of functional psychoses: an essay",
  author   = "Bergsholm, Per",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The categories of functional psychoses build on views
              of influential professionals. There have long been four main
              categories - affective, schizophrenic,
              schizoaffective/cycloid/reactive/polymorphic, and
              delusional/paranoid psychoses. The last three are included in
              ``psychotic disorders''. However, this dichotomy and the
              distinctions between categories may have been over-estimated and
              contributed to lack of progress. TEN TOPICS RELEVANT FOR THE
              DIAGNOSIS OF FUNCTIONAL PSYCHOSES: 1. The categories of
              functional psychoses have varied with time, place and
              professionals' views, with moving boundaries, especially between
              schizophrenia and affective psychoses. 2. Catatonia is most often
              related to affective and organic psychoses, and paranoia is
              related to grandiosity and guilt, calling in question catatonic
              and paranoid schizophrenia. Arguments exist for schizophrenia
              being a ``misdiagnosis''. 3. In some countries schizophrenia has
              been renamed, with positive consequences. 4. The doctrine of
              ``unitary psychosis'', which included abnormal affect, was left
              in the second half of the 1800s. 5. This was followed by a
              dichotomy between schizophrenia and affective psychoses and
              broadening of the schizophrenia concept, whereas affective
              symptoms were strongly downgraded. 6. Many homogeneous psychoses
              with mixtures of schizophrenic and affective symptoms were
              described and related to ``psychotic disorders'', although they
              might as well be affective disorders. 7. Critique of the
              extensive schizophrenia concept led to, in DSM-III and ICD-10,
              affective symptoms being exclusion criteria for schizophrenia and
              acceptance of mood-incongruent psychotic symptoms in affective
              psychoses. 8. However, affective symptoms are often difficult to
              acknowledge, diagnosis is often done on the basis of tradition
              and previous education, and patients' affect characterized
              accordingly. 9. DSM-5 is up-dated with separate chapters for
              catatonia and psychotic symptoms, and removal of the subtypes of
              schizophrenia. However, time may be running out for categorical
              psychosis diagnoses, which may be replaced by continuum,
              spectrum, dimensional and research domain criteria, in line with
              new biological data 10. This is supported by treatment responses
              across categories. CONCLUSION: The time-consuming works on
              diagnosis of psychoses may have hampered progress. Chronic mood
              disorders may appear as schizophrenic or paranoid psychosis,
              end-stages like heart failure in heart diseases. This underscores
              the importance of early and optimal treatment of mood disorders.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: The aim of this review is to identify consistent themes
              among the qualitative literature on stigma as experienced by
              patients with schizophrenia receiving community mental health
              care. With the treatment focus of schizophrenia nowadays shifting
              more and more towards community-based mental health care,
              professionals need to be aware of the increased vulnerability of
              their clients in their social environment as a result of stigma
              towards their disease. In-depth knowledge on stigma is critical
              in order to offer a dignifying community mental health care.
              METHODS: A systematic search of the qualitative literature in Web
              of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO and Francis was performed to review
              the subjective experiences and ideas on stigma in outpatients
              with schizophrenia. RESULTS: Three major themes were identified
              in 18 studies and need to be taken into consideration when
              implementing an adequate community mental health care: (i) the
              continuing existence of stigma inherent in the health care
              setting, (ii) the importance of relational aspects of stigma
              encounters in daily life and (iii) the significance of the
              behavioural aspects related to previous stigma experiences and
              beliefs among patients. CONCLUSIONS: Despite much effort in
              community treatment, patients still experience stigma and
              discrimination. Community mental health care professionals should
              not only be aware of structural problems in mental health care,
              but should also pay considerable attention towards the relational
              and behavioural aspects in their clients' life concerning stigma.
              Furthermore, they have the crucial role in the community to raise
              awareness about stigma in order to increase their clients'

              organizations and the Department of Psychiatry of the University
              Medical Center Groningen in The Netherlands, covering a catchment
              area of 3.1 million inhabitants. A sample of 131 remitted
              first-episode patients, aged 18 to 45 years, with a DSM-IV
              diagnosis of schizophrenia or related psychotic disorder was
              included (i.e., all patients with a first psychotic episode from
              October 2001 through December 2002 who were willing to
              participate). After 6 months of positive symptom remission, they
              were randomly and openly assigned to the discontinuation strategy
              or maintenance treatment. Maintenance treatment was carried out
              according to American Psychiatric Association guidelines,
              preferably using low-dose atypical antipsychotics. The
              discontinuation strategy was carried out by gradual
              symptom-guided tapering of dosage and discontinuation if
              feasible. Follow-up was 18 months. Main outcome measures were
              relapse rates and social and vocational functioning. RESULTS:
              Twice as many relapses occurred with the discontinuation strategy
              (43\% vs. 21\%, p = .011). Of patients who received the strategy,
              approximately 20\% were successfully discontinued. Recurrent
              symptoms caused another approximately 30\% to restart
              antipsychotic treatment, while in the remaining patients
              discontinuation was not feasible at all. There were no advantages
              of the discontinuation strategy regarding functional outcome.
              CONCLUSIONS: Only a limited number of patients can be
              successfully discontinued. High relapse rates do not allow a
              discontinuation strategy to be universal practice. However, if
              relapse risk can be carefully managed by close monitoring, in
              some remitted first-episode patients a guided discontinuation
              strategy may offer a feasible alternative to maintenance
              treatment. Further research is needed to find predictors of

              assessment of treatment response, remission, relapse, and
              recovery is important. Therefore, the present study aimed to
              develop operational definitions of clinical outcomes in
              first-episode psychosis. METHODS: A questionnaire was developed
              by a panel of experts and underwent three revisions. The final
              survey was presented to 150 psychiatrists who were members of the
              Korean Society for Schizophrenia Research. Respondents selected
              factors that they believed were important to consider while
              defining treatment response, remission, relapse, and recovery
              using a 6-point Likert scale. Selected factors that constituted
              each definition were statistically extracted, and operational
              definitions were developed. RESULTS: A total of 91 experts
              responded to the survey. The extent of reduction in
              psychopathology, socio-occupational functioning, and duration of
              each state were the core factors of each definition. Outcomes
              obtained from discussions and consultations by experts have been
              summarized and proposed. CONCLUSION: The criteria developed in
              this survey tended to be somewhat stricter than those used by
              other studies. The fundamental reason for this is that this
              survey focused on first-episode psychosis. A better understanding

              of scientific inquiry in the late 18th century, debates about
              diagnosis have been at its very heart. Considered by many a
              requirement for clinical communication as well as for systematic
              study, others have critiqued psychiatric diagnosis for being
              modeled on a medical conception of disease that is ill-suited to
              the specific nature of mental disorders. Based on a review of
              seminal positions in the conceptual history of psychiatry and an
              examination of their epistemological underpinnings, we propose to
              consider diagnosis as dialogue. Such understanding, we argue, can
              serve as a meta-framework that provides a conceptual and
              practical umbrella to encourage open-minded conversation across
              the diverse conceptual and experiential frameworks that are

              effects of cocaine, and alterations in dopamine function might be
              involved in cocaine dependence. The goals of the present study
              were to characterize pre- and postsynaptic dopamine function in

              dopamine response to an acute amphetamine challenge was assessed
              in striatal subregions in cocaine-dependent and healthy
              comparison participants using positron emission tomography (PET).
              Furthermore, the relationship between this dopamine response and
              the choice to self-administer cocaine in a laboratory model of
              relapse was investigated. METHOD: Twenty-four cocaine-dependent
              participants and 24 matched healthy subjects underwent
              [(11)C]raclopride scans under a baseline condition and following
              intravenous amphetamine administration (0.3 mg/kg).
              Cocaine-dependent participants also completed cocaine
              self-administration sessions in which a priming dose of cocaine
              was followed by the choice to either self-administer subsequent
              cocaine doses or receive a monetary reward. RESULTS: Cocaine
              dependence was associated with a marked reduction in
              amphetamine-induced dopamine release in each of the functional
              subregions of the striatum (limbic striatum: -1.2\% in

              Blunted dopamine transmission in the ventral striatum and
              anterior caudate was predictive of the choice for cocaine over
              money. CONCLUSIONS: Cocaine dependence is associated with

              neuroscience. We argue that neglect of these issues is a crucial
              source of the stagnation of psychiatric research. In honor of the

              offer a critique of the contemporary ``operationalist''
              epistemology, a critique that is consistent with Jaspers' views.
              Symptoms and signs cannot be properly understood or identified
              apart from an appreciation of the nature of consciousness or
              subjectivity, which in turn cannot be treated as a collection of
              thing-like, mutually independent objects, accessible to
              context-free, ``atheoretical'' definitions or unproblematic forms

              maintain clinic-like steady state levels for 8 weeks.
              Longitudinal in vivo MRI scanning (T₂-weighted) was carried out
              at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks, after which animals were
              perfused and their brains preserved for ex vivo MRI scanning.
              Region of interest analyses were performed on magnetic resonance
              images (both in vivo as well as ex vivo) along with postmortem
              stereology using the Cavalieri estimator probe. RESULTS: Chronic
              (8 weeks) exposure to both haloperidol and olanzapine resulted in
              significant decreases in whole-brain volume (6\% to 8\%) compared
              with vehicle-treated control subjects, driven mainly by a
              decrease in frontal cerebral cortex volume (8\% to 12\%).
              Hippocampal, corpus striatum, lateral ventricles, and corpus
              callosum volumes were not significantly different from control
              subjects, suggesting a differential effect of APD on the cortex.
              These results were corroborated by ex vivo MRI scans and
              decreased cortical volume was confirmed postmortem by stereology.
              CONCLUSIONS: This is the first systematic whole-brain MRI study
              of the effects of APD, which highlights significant effects on
              the cortex. Although caution needs to be exerted when
              extrapolating results from animals to patients, the approach
              provides a tractable method for linking in vivo MRI findings to
              their histopathological origins.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Follow-up studies have found that a substantial number
              of patients with schizophrenia achieve full recovery (i.e.,
              sustained improvement in both symptoms and social/vocational
              functioning) when examined decades after an index admission. This
              study addressed recovery during the crucial early course of the
              illness. METHOD: Subjects in their first episode of schizophrenia
              or schizoaffective disorder (N=118) were assessed at baseline and
              then treated according to a medication algorithm. Full recovery
              required concurrent remission of positive and negative symptoms
              and adequate social/vocational functioning (fulfillment of
              age-appropriate role expectations, performance of daily living
              tasks without supervision, and engagement in social
              interactions). RESULTS: After 5 years, 47.2\% (95\%
              CI=36.0\%-58.4\%) of the subjects achieved symptom remission, and
              25.5\% (95\% CI=16.1\%-34.7\%) had adequate social functioning
              for 2 years or more. Only 13.7\% (95\% CI=6.4\%-20.9\%) of
              subjects met full recovery criteria for 2 years or longer. Better
              cognitive functioning at stabilization was associated with full
              recovery, adequate social/vocational functioning, and symptom
              remission. Shorter duration of psychosis before study entry
              predicted both full recovery and symptom remission. More cerebral
              asymmetry was associated with full recovery and adequate
              social/vocational functioning; a schizoaffective diagnosis
              predicted symptom remission. CONCLUSIONS: Although some patients
              with first-episode schizophrenia can achieve sustained
              symptomatic and functional recovery, the overall rate of recovery
              during the early years of the illness is low.",

              many patients with psychosis that can lead to numerous
              comorbidities and which reduce the lifespan. While the
              pathophysiology of AIWG remains poorly understood, numerous
              studies have reported a positive association between AIWG and the
              therapeutic benefit of antipsychotic medications. Objectives: To
              review the literature to (1) determine if AIWG is consistently
              associated with therapeutic benefit and (2) investigate which
              variables may mediate such an association. Data Sources: MEDLINE,
              Google Scholar, Cochrane Database and PsycINFO databases were
              searched for articles containing all the following exploded MESH
              terms: schizophrenia [AND] antipsychotic agents/neuroleptics
              [AND] (weight gain [OR] lipids [OR] insulin [OR] leptin) [AND]
              treatment outcome. Results were limited to full-text, English
              journal articles. Results: Our literature search uncovered 31
              independent studies which investigated an AIWG-therapeutic
              benefit association with a total of 6063 enrolled individuals
              diagnosed with schizophrenia or another serious mental illness
              receiving antipsychotic medications. Twenty-two studies found a
              positive association while, 10 studies found no association and
              one study reported a negative association. Study variables
              including medication compliance, sex, ethnicity, or prior
              antipsychotic exposure did not appear to consistently affect the
              AIWG-therapeutic benefit relationship. In contrast, there was
              some evidence that controlling for baseline BMI/psychopathology,
              duration of treatment and specific agent studied [i.e.,
              olanzapine (OLZ) or clozapine (CLZ)] strengthened the
              relationship between AIWG and therapeutic benefit. Limitations:
              There were limitations of the reviewed studies in that many had
              small sample sizes, and/or were retrospective. The heterogeneity
              of the studies also made comparisons difficult and publication
              bias was not controlled for. Conclusions: An AIWG-therapeutic
              benefit association may exist and is most likely to be observed
              in OLZ and CLZ-treated patients. The clinical meaningfulness of
              this association remains unclear and weight gain and other
              metabolic comorbidities should be identified and treated to the
              same targets as the general population. Further research should
              continue to explore the links between therapeutic benefit and
              metabolic health with emphasis on both pre-clinical work and
              well-designed prospective clinical trials examining metabolic
              parameters associated, but also occurring independently to AIWG.",

              models have been developed to increase patient involvement in

              effect of a shared decision-making intervention (SDMI) for
              substance-dependent patients on patients' and clinicians'
              perceptions of therapeutic alliance. METHODS: Clinicians were
              randomly assigned to SDMI or usual procedures to reach a
              treatment agreement. SDMI is a structured, manualized, 5-session
              procedure to facilitate treatment agreement and consists of five
              standardized sessions. RESULTS: Patients' perceptions of the
              therapeutic alliance were very favorable at start of treatment,
              and no differences were found between intervention groups.
              Clinicians' scores on perceived helpfulness and on the overall

              beginning of the searched time period and until October 1, 2019
              (PROSPERO registration no. CRD42019119148). Study Selection: Of
              the 18,043 screened studies, controlled and cohort trials that
              assessed withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation of oral
              antipsychotics were included in the random-effects model. Studies
              that did not implement placebo substitution were excluded from
              analyses. The primary outcome was the proportion of individuals
              with withdrawal symptoms after antipsychotic discontinuation. We
              compared a control group with continued antipsychotic treatment
              in the assessment of odds ratio and number needed to harm (NNH).
              Data Extraction: We followed guidelines by the Cochrane
              Collaboration, PRISMA, and MOOSE. Results: Five studies with a
              total of 261 individuals were included. The primary outcome,
              proportion of individuals with withdrawal symptoms after
              antipsychotic discontinuation, was 0.53 (95\% CI, 0.37-0.70; I2 =
              82.98\%, P < 0.01). An odds ratio of 7.97 (95\% CI, 2.39-26.58;

              discontinuation. Conclusion: Withdrawal symptoms appear to occur
              frequently after abrupt discontinuation of an oral antipsychotic.
              The lack of randomized controlled trials with low risk of bias on

  abstract = "We offer provisional support for a new cognitive approach to
              understanding and treating drug-resistant auditory hallucinations
              in people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Study 1 emphasises
              the relevance of the cognitive model by detailing the
              behavioural, cognitive and affective responses to persistent
              voices in 26 patients, demonstrating that highly disparate
              relationships with voices-fear, reassurance, engagement and
              resistance-reflect vital differences in beliefs about the voices.
              All patients viewed their voices as omnipotent and omniscient.
              However, beliefs about the voice's identity and meaning led to
              voices being construed as either 'benevolent' or 'malevolent'.
              Patients provided cogent reasons (evidence) for these beliefs
              which were not always linked to voice content; indeed in 31\% of
              cases beliefs were incongruous with content, as would be
              anticipated by a cognitive model. Without fail, voices believed
              to be malevolent provoked fear and were resisted and those
              perceived as benevolent were courted. However, in the case of
              imperative voices, the primary influence on whether commands were
              obeyed was the severity of the command. Study 2 illustrates how
              these core beliefs about voices may become a new target for
              treatment. We describe the application of an adapted version of
              cognitive therapy (CT) to the treatment of four patients'
              drug-resistant voices. Where patients were on medication, this
              was held constant while beliefs about the voices' omnipotence,
              identity, and purpose were systematically disputed and tested.
              Large and stable reductions in conviction in these beliefs were
              reported, and these were associated with reduced distress,
              increased adaptive behaviour, and unexpectedly, a fall in voice
              activity. These changes were corroborated by the responsible
              psychiatrists. Collectively, the cases attest to the promise of
              CT as a treatment for auditory hallucinations.",

              support the idea that second-generation antipsychotics have a
              reduced risk for tardive dyskinesia, compared to first-generation
              antipsychotics, although the doses of haloperidol used in the
              comparator studies were relatively high. More carefully designed
              studies, ideally lasting beyond 1 year and comparing the effects
              of different second-generation antipsychotics in patients who
              have never taken first-generation antipsychotics, are needed to
              estimate the true risk. It would not appear premature for
              clinicians to consider these findings in making long-term
              treatment decisions.",
